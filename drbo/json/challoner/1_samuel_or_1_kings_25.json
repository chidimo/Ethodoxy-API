{"1 Samuel or 1 Kings__25": {"22__If I leave": "David certainly sinned in his designs against Nabal and his family, as he himself was afterwards sensible, when he blessed God for hindering him from executing the revenge he had proposed.", "25__His name": "Nabal, in Hebrew, signifies a fool.", "39__Blessed be": "David praiseth God, on this occasion, not out of joy for the death of Nabal (which would have argued a rancour of heart), but because he saw that God had so visibly taken his cause in hand, in punishing the injury done to him; whilst, by a merciful providence he kept him from revenging himself."}}

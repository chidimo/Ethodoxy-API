{"2 Kings or 4 Kings__05": {"15__A blessing": "a present.", "19__Go in peace": "What the prophet here allowed, was not an outward conformity to an idolatrous worship; but only a service which by his office he owed to his masterwho on all public occasions leaned on himso that his bowing down when his master bowed himself down was not in effect adoring the idolsnor was it so understood by the standers by, since he publicly professed himself a worshipper of the only true and living God, but it was no more than doing a civil office to the king his master, whose leaning upon him obliged him to bow at the same time that he bowed."}}

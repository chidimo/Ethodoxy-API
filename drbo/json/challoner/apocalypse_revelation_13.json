{"Apocalypse / Revelation__13": {"1__A beast": "This first beast with seven heads and ten horns, is probably the whole company of infidels, enemies and persecutors of the people of God, from the beginning to the end of the world. The seven heads are seven kings, that is, seven principal kingdoms or empires, which have exercised, or shall exercise, tyrannical power over the people of God; of these, five were then fallen, viz.the Egyptian, Assyrian, Chaldean, Persian, and Grecian monarchiesone was present, viz., the empire of Romeand the seventh and chiefest was to come, viz., the great Antichrist and his empire. The ten horns may be understood of ten lesser persecutors.", "3__One of his heads": "Some understand this of the mortal wound, which the idolatry of the Roman empire (signified by the sixth head) received from Constantine; which was, as it were, healed again by Julian the Apostate.", "6__His tabernacle": "That is, his church and his saints.", "8__Slain from the beginning": "In the foreknowledge of God; and inasmuch as all mercy and grace, from the beginning, was given in view of his death and passion.", "11__Another beast": "This second beast with two horns, may be understood of the heathenish priests and magicians; the principal promoters both of idolatry and persecution.", "18__Six hundred sixty-six": "The numeral letters of his name shall make up this number."}}

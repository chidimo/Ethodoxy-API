{"Hebrews__06": {"1__The word of the beginning": "The first rudiments of the Christian doctrine.", "4__It is impossible": "The meaning is, that it is impossible for such as have fallen after baptism, to be again baptized; and very hard for such as have apostatized from the faith, after having received many graces, to return again to the happy state from which they fell."}}

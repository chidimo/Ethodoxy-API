{"Jeremiah or Jeremias__23": {"34__Burden of the Lord": "This expression is here rejected and disallowed, at least for those timesbecause it was then used in mockery and contempt by the false prophets, and unbelieving people, who ridiculed the repeated threats of Jeremias under the name of his burdens.", "39__Out of my presence": "That is, the Lord declares that out of his presence he will cast them, and bring them to captivity for their transgressions."}}

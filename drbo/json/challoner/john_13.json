{"John__13": {"1__Before the festival day of the pasch": "This was the fourth and last pasch of the ministry of Christ, and according to the common computation, was in the thirty-third year of our Lordand in the year of the world 4036. Some chronologers are of opinion that our Saviour suffered in the thirty-seventh year of his agebut these different opinions on this subject are of no consequence.", "27__That which thou dost, do quickly": "It is not a license, much less a command, to go about his treasonbut a signification to him that Christ would not hinder or resist what he was about, do it as soon as he pleasedbut was both ready and desirous to suffer for our redemption."}}

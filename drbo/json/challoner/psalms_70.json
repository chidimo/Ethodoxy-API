{"Psalms__70": {"1__Of the sons of Jonadab": "The Rechabites, of whom see Jer. 35. By this addition of the seventy-two interpreters, we gather that this psalm was usually sung in the synagogue, in the person of the Rechabites, and of those who were first carried away into captivity.", "15__Learning": "As much as to say, I build not upon human learning, but only on the power and justice of God."}}

{"Psalms__83": {"6__In his heart he hath disposed to ascend by steps": "Ascensiones in corde suo disposuit. As by steps men ascended to the temple of God situated on a hill; so the good Christian ascends towards the eternal temple by certain steps of virtue disposed or ordered within the heartand this whilst he lives as yet in the body, in this vale of tears, the place which man hath setthat is, which he hath brought himself tobeing cast out of paradise for his sin."}}

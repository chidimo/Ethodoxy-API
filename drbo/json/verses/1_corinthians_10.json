{"1 Corinthians__10": {"1": "For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea.", "2": "And all<u>\n                in Moses\n               </u>were baptized, in the cloud, and in the sea:", "3": "And did all eat the same spiritual food,", "4": "And all drank the same spiritual drink; (and they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.)", "5": "But with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the desert.", "6": "Now these things were done in a figure of us, that we should not covet evil things as they also coveted.", "7": "Neither become ye idolaters, as some of them, as it is written: The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play.", "8": "Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, and there fell in one day three and twenty thousand.", "9": "Neither let us tempt Christ: as some of them tempted, and perished by the serpents.", "10": "Neither do you murmur: as some of them murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer.", "11": "Now all these things happened to them in figure: and they are written for our correction, upon whom<u>\n                the ends of the world\n               </u>are come.", "12": "Wherefore he that thinketh himself to stand, let him take heed lest he fall.", "13": "Let no temptation<u>\n                take hold on you\n               </u>, but such as is human. And God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able: but will make also with temptation issue, that you may be able to bear it.", "14": "Wherefore, my dearly beloved, fly from the service of idols.", "15": "I speak as to wise men: judge ye yourselves what I say.", "16": "The chalice of benediction,<u>\n                which we bless\n               </u>, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? And the bread, which we break, is it not the partaking of the body of the Lord?", "17": "For we, being many, are<u>\n                one bread\n               </u>, one body, all that partake of one bread.", "18": "Behold Israel according to the flesh: are not they, that eat of the sacrifices, partakers of the altar?", "19": "What then? Do I say, that what is offered in sacrifice to idols, is any thing? Or, that the idol is any thing?", "20": "But the things which the heathens sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God. And I would not that you should be made partakers with devils.", "21": "You cannot drink the chalice of the Lord, and the chalice of devils: you cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord, and of the table of devils.", "22": "Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he? All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient.", "23": "All things are lawful for me, but all things do not edify.", "24": "Let no man seek his own, but that which is another's.", "25": "Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat; asking no question for conscience' sake.", "26": "The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof.", "27": "If any of them that believe not, invite you, and you will be willing to go; eat of any thing that is set before you, asking no question for conscience' sake.", "28": "But if any man say: This has been sacrificed to idols, do not eat of it for his sake that told it, and for conscience' sake.", "29": "Conscience, I say, not thy own, but the other's. For why is my liberty judged by another man's conscience?", "30": "If I partake with thanksgiving, why am I evil spoken of, for that for which I give thanks?", "31": "Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all to the glory of God.", "32": "Be without offence to the Jews, and to the Gentiles, and to the church of God:", "33": "As I also in all things please all men, not seeking that which is profitable to myself, but to many, that may be saved."}}

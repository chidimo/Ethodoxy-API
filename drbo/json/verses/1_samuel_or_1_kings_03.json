And he answered: Here am I.", "5": "And he ran to Heli and said: Here am I: for thou didst call me. He said: I did not call: go back and sleep. And he went and slept.", "6": "And the Lord called Samuel again. And Samuel arose and went to Heli, and said: Here am I: for thou calledst me. He answered: I did not call thee, my son: return and sleep.", "7": "Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, neither had the word of the Lord been revealed to him.", "8": "And the Lord called Samuel again the third time. And he arose up and went to Heli.", "9": "And said: Here am I: for thou didst call me. Then Heli understood that the Lord called the child, and he said to Samuel: Go, and sleep: and if he shall call thee any more, thou shalt say: Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth.

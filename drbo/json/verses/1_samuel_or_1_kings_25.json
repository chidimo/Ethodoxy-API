Now therefore let thy servants find favour in thy eyes: for we are come in a good day, whatsoever thy hand shall find give to thy servants, and to thy son David.", "9": "And when David's servants came, they spoke to Nabal all these words in David's name: and then held their peace.", "10": "But Nabal answering the servants of David, said: Who is David? and what is the son of Isai? servants are multiplied now a days who flee from their masters.", "11": "Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and the flesh of my cattle, which I have killed for my shearers, and give to men whom I know not whence they are?", "12": "So the servants of David went back their way, and returning came and told him all the words that he said.", "13": "Then David said to his young men: Let every man gird on his sword.

{"1 Samuel or 1 Kings__27": {"1": "And David said in his heart: I shall gone day or other fall into the hands of Saul: is it not better for me to flee, and to be saved in the land of the Philistines, that Saul may despair of me, and cease to seek me in all the coasts of Israel? I will flee then out of his hands.", "2": "And David arose and went away, both he and the six hundred men that were with him, to Achis the son of Maoch, king of Geth.", "3": "And David dwelt with Achis at Geth, he and his men: every man with his household, and David with his two wives, Achinoam the Jezrahelitess, and Abigail the wife of Nabal of Carmel.", "4": "And it was told Saul that David was fled to Geth, and he sought no more after him.", "5": "And David said to Achis: If I have found favour in thy sight, let a place be given me in one of the cities of this country, that I may dwell there: for why should thy servant dwell in the royal city with thee?", "6": "Then Achis gave him Siceleg that day: for which reason Siceleg belongeth to the kings of Juda unto this day.", "7": "And the time that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines, was four months.", "8": "And David and his men went up, and<u>pillaged Gessuri</u>, and Gerzi, and the Amalecites: for these were of old the inhabitants of the countries, as men go to Sur, even to the land of Egypt.", "9": "And David wasted all the land, and left neither man nor woman alive: and took away the sheep and the oxen, and the asses, and the camels, and the apparel, and returned and came to Achis.", "10": "And Achis said to him: Whom hast thou gone against today? David answered: Against the south of Juda, and against the south of Jerameel, and against the south of Ceni.", "11": "And David saved neither man nor woman, neither brought he any of them to Geth, saying: Lest they should speak against us. So did David, and such was his proceeding all the days that he dwelt in the country of the Philistines.", "12": "And Achis believed David, saying: He hath done much harm to his people Israel: therefore he shall be my servant for ever."}}

And I hope that you shall know unto the end:", "14": "As also you have known us in part, that we are your glory, as you also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.", "15": "And in this confidence I had a mind to come to you before, that you might have a second grace:", "16": "And to pass by you into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be brought on my way towards Judea.", "17": "Whereas then I was thus minded, did I use lightness? Or, the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that there should be with me, It is, and It is not?", "18": "But God is faithful, for our preaching which was to you, was not, It is, and It is not.", "19": "For the Son of God, Jesus Christ who was preached among you by us, by me, and Sylvanus, and Timothy, was not, It is and It is not, but,<u>\n              It is, was in him\n             </u>.", "20": "For all the promises of God are in him, It is; therefore also by him, amen to God, unto our glory.", "21": "Now he that confirmeth us with you in Christ, and that hath anointed us, is God:", "22": "Who also hath sealed us, and given the pledge of the Spirit in our hearts.", "23": "But I call God to witness upon my soul, that to spare you, I came not any more to Corinth: not because we exercise dominion over your faith: but we are helpers of your joy: for in faith you stand."}}

{"2 Corinthians__02": {"1": "But I determined this with myself, not to come to you again in sorrow.", "2": "For if I make you sorrowful, who is he then that can make me glad, but the same who is made sorrowful by me?", "3": "And I wrote this same to you; that I may not, when I come, have sorrow upon sorrow, from them of whom I ought to rejoice: having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.", "4": "For out of much affliction and anguish of heart, I wrote to you with many tears: not that you should be made sorrowful: but that you might know the charity I have more abundantly towards you.", "5": "And if any one have caused grief, he hath not grieved me; but in part, that I may not burden you all.", "6": "To him who is such a one, this rebuke is sufficient, which is given by many:", "7": "So that on the contrary, you should rather forgive him and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.", "8": "Wherefore, I beseech you, that you would confirm your charity towards him.", "9": "For to this end also did I write, that I may know the experiment of you, whether you be obedient in all things.", "10": "And to whom you have pardoned any thing,<u>\n                I also\n               </u>. For, what I have pardoned, if I have pardoned any thing, for your sakes have I done it in the person of Christ.", "11": "That we be not overreached by Satan. For we are not ignorant of his devices.", "12": "And when I was come to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened unto me in the Lord,", "13": "I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother; but bidding them farewell, I went into Macedonia.", "14": "Now thanks be to God, who always maketh us to triumph in Christ Jesus, and manifesteth the odour of his knowledge by us in every place.", "15": "For we are the good odour of Christ unto God, in them that are saved, and in them that perish.", "16": "To the one indeed<u>\n                the odour of death\n               </u>unto death: but to the others the odour of life unto life. And for these things who is so sufficient?", "17": "For we are not as many, adulterating the word of God; but with sincerity, but as from God, before God, in Christ we speak."}}

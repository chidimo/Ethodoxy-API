{"2 Corinthians__05": {"1": "For we know, if our earthly house of this habitation be dissolved, that we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in heaven.", "2": "For in this also we groan, desiring to be clothed upon with our habitation that is from heaven.", "3": "Yet so that we be found clothed, not naked.", "4": "For we also, who are in this tabernacle, do groan, being burthened; because we would not be unclothed, but clothed upon, that that which is mortal may be swallowed up by life.", "5": "Now he that maketh us for this very thing, is God, who hath given us the pledge of the Spirit.", "6": "Therefore having always confidence, knowing that, while we are in the body, we are absent from the Lord.", "7": "(For we walk by faith, and not by sight.)", "8": "But we are confident, and have a good will to be absent rather from the body, and to be present with the Lord.", "9": "And therefore we labour, whether absent or present, to please him.", "10": "For we must all be manifested before the judgement seat of Christ, that every one may receive<u>\n                the proper things of the body\n               </u>, according as he hath done, whether it be good or evil.", "11": "Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we use persuasion to men; but to God we are manifest. And I trust also that in your consciences we are manifest.", "12": "We commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory in our behalf; that you may have somewhat to answer them who glory in face, and not in heart.", "13": "For whether we be transported in mind, it is to God; or whether we be sober, it is for you.", "14": "For the charity of Christ presseth us: judging this, that if one died for all, then all were dead.", "15": "And Christ died for all; that they also who live, may not now live to themselves, but unto him who died for them, and rose again.", "16": "Wherefore henceforth,<u>\n                we know no man according to the flesh\n               </u>. And if we have known Christ according to the flesh; but now we know him so no longer.", "17": "If then any be in Christ a new creature, the old things are passed away, behold all things are made new.", "18": "But all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Christ; and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation.", "19": "For God indeed was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing to them their sins; and he hath placed in us the word of reconciliation.", "20": "For Christ therefore we are ambassadors, God as it were exhorting by us. For Christ, we beseech you, be reconciled to God.", "21": "Him, who knew no sin, he hath made<u>\n                sin for us\n               </u>, that we might be made the justice of God in him."}}

{"Amos__03": {"1": "Hear the word that the Lord hath spoken concerning you, O ye children of Israel: concerning the whole family that I brought up out of the land of Egypt, saying:", "2": "You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore will I<u>\n                visit upon\n               </u>you all your iniquities.", "3": "Shall two walk together except they be agreed?", "4": "Will a lion roar in the forest, if he have no prey? will the lion's whelp cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?", "5": "Will the bird fall into the snare upon the earth, if there be no fowler? Shall the snare be taken up from the earth, before it hath taken somewhat?", "6": "Shall the trumpet sound in a city, and the people not be afraid? Shall there be<u>\n                evil in a city\n               </u>, which the Lord hath not done?", "7": "For the Lord God doth nothing without revealing his secret to his servants the prophets.", "8": "The lion shall roar, who will not fear? The Lord God hath spoken, who shall not prophesy?", "9": "Publish it in the houses of Azotus, and in the houses of the land of Egypt, and say: Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria, and behold the many follies in the midst thereof, and them that suffer oppression in the inner rooms thereof.", "10": "And they have not known to do the right thing, saith the Lord, storing up iniquity, and robberies in their houses.", "11": "Therefore thus saith the Lord God: The land shall be in tribulation, and shall be compassed about: and thy strength shall be taken away from thee, and thy houses shall be spoiled.", "12": "Thus saith the Lord: As if a shepherd should get out of the lion's mouth two legs, or the tip of the ear: so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria, in a piece of a bed, and in the couch of Damascus.", "13": "Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord the God of hosts:", "14": "That in the day when I shall begin to visit the transgressions of Israel, I will visit upon him, and upon the altars of Bethel: and the horns of the altars shall be cut off, and shall fall to the ground.", "15": "And I will strike the winter house with the summer house: and the houses of ivory shall perish, and many houses shall be destroyed, saith the Lord."}}

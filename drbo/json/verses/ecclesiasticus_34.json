{"Ecclesiasticus *__34": {"1": "The hopes of a man that is void of understanding are vain and deceitful: and dreams lift up fools.", "2": "The man that giveth heed to lying visions, is like to him that catcheth at a shadow, and followeth after the wind.", "3": "The vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing to another: as when a man's likeness is before the face of a man.", "4": "What can be made clean by the unclean? and what truth can come from that which is false?", "5": "Deceitful divinations and lying omens and the dreams of evildoers, are vanity:", "6": "And the heart fancieth as that of a woman in travail: except it be a vision sent forth from the most High, set no thy heart upon them.", "7": "For dreams have deceived many, and they have failed that put their trust in them.", "8": "The word of the law shall be fulfilled without a lie, and wisdom shall be made plain in the mouth of the faithful.", "9": "What doth he know, that hath not been tried? A man that hath much experience, shall think of many things: and he that hath learned many things, shall shew forth understanding.", "10": "He that hath no experience, knoweth little: and he that hath been experienced in many things, multiplieth prudence.", "11": "He that hath not been tried, what manner of things doth he know? he that hath been surprised, shall abound with subtlety.", "12": "I have seen many things by travelling, and many customs of things.", "13": "Sometimes I have been in danger of death for these things, and I have been delivered by the grace of God.", "14": "The spirit of those that fear God; is sought after, and by his regard shall be blessed.", "15": "For their hope is on him that saveth them, and the eyes of God are upon them that love him.", "16": "He that feareth the Lord shall tremble at nothing, and shall not be afraid for he is his hope.", "17": "The soul of him that feareth the Lord is blessed.", "18": "To whom doth he look, and who in his strength?", "19": "The eyes of the Lord are upon them that fear him, he is their powerful protector, and strong stay, a defence from the heat, and a cover from the sun at noon,", "20": "A preservation from stumbling, and a help from falling; he raiseth up the soul, and enlighteneth the eyes, and giveth health, and life, and blessing.", "21": "The offering of him that sacrificeth of a thing wrongfully gotten, is stained, and the mockeries of the unjust are not acceptable.", "22": "The Lord is only for them that wait upon him in the way of truth and justice.", "23": "The most High approveth not the gifts of the wicked: neither hath he respect to the oblations of the unjust, nor will he be pacified for sins by the multitude of their sacrifices.", "24": "He that offereth sacrifice of the goods of the poor, is as one that sacrificeth the son in the presence of his father.", "25": "The bread of the needy, is the life of the poor: he that defraudeth them thereof, is a man of blood.", "26": "He that taketh away the bread gotten by sweat, is like him that killeth his neighbour.", "27": "He that sheddeth blood, and he that defraudeth the labourer of his hire, are brothers.", "28": "When one buildeth up, and another pulleth down: what profit have they but the labour?", "29": "When one prayeth, and another curseth: whose voice will God hear?", "30": "He that washeth himself after touching the dead, if he toucheth him again, what doth his washing avail?", "31": "So a man that fasteth for his sins, and doth the same again, what doth his humbling himself profit him? who will hear his prayer?"}}

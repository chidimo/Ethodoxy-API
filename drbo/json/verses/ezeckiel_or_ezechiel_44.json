them.", "12": "Because they ministered to them before their idols, and were a stumblingblock of iniquity to the house of Israel: therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith the Lord God, and they shall bear their iniquity:", "13": "And they shall not come near to me to do the office of priest to me, neither shall they come near to any of my holy things that are by the holy of holies:

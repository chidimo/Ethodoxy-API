{"Galatians__03": {"1": "O senseless Galatians, who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been set forth, crucified among you?", "2": "This only would I learn of you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?", "3": "Are you so foolish, that, whereas you began in the Spirit, you would now be made perfect by the flesh?", "4": "Have you suffered so great things in vain? If it be yet in vain.", "5": "He therefore who giveth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you; doth he do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of the faith?", "6": "As it is written: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him unto justice.", "7": "Know ye therefore, that they who are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.", "8": "And the scripture, foreseeing, that God justifieth the Gentiles by faith, told unto Abraham before: In thee shall all nations be blessed.", "9": "Therefore they that are of faith, shall be blessed with faithful Abraham.", "10": "For as many as are of the works of the law, are under a curse. For it is written: Cursed is every one, that abideth not in all things, which are written in the book of the law to do them.", "11": "But that in the law no man is justified with God, it is manifest: because the just man liveth by faith.", "12": "But the law is not of faith: but, He that doth those things, shall live in them.", "13": "Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written: Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:", "14": "That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus: that we may receive the promise of the Spirit by faith.", "15": "Brethren (I speak after the manner of man,) yet a man's testament, if it be confirmed, no man despiseth, nor addeth to it.", "16": "To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed. He saith not, And to his seeds, as of many: but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.", "17": "Now this I say, that the testament which was confirmed by God, the law which was made after four hundred and thirty years, doth not disannul, to make the promise of no effect.", "18": "For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise. But God gave it to Abraham by promise.", "19": "Why then was the law? It was set<u>\n                because of transgressions\n               </u>, until the seed should come, to whom he made the promise, being<u>\n                ordained by angels\n               </u>in the hand of a mediator.", "20": "Now a mediator is not of one: but God is one.", "21": "Was the law then against the promises of God? God forbid. For if there had been a law given which could give life, verily justice should have been by the law.", "22": "But the scripture<u>\n                hath concluded all under sin\n               </u>, that the promise, by the faith of Jesus Christ, might be given to them that believe.", "23": "But before the faith came, we were kept under the law shut up, unto that faith which was to be revealed.", "24": "Wherefore the law was our<u>\n                pedagogue\n               </u>in Christ, that we might be justified by faith.", "25": "But after the faith is come, we are no longer under a pedagogue.", "26": "For you are all the children of God by faith, in Christ Jesus.", "27": "For as many of you as have been baptized in Christ, have put on Christ.", "28": "There is<u>\n                neither Jew\n               </u>nor Greek: there is neither bond nor free: there is neither male nor female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus.", "29": "And if you be Christ's, then are you the seed of Abraham, heirs according to the promise."}}

{"Genesis__32": {"1": "Jacob also went on the journey he had begun: and the angels of God met him.", "2": "And when he saw them, he said: These are the camps of God, and he called the name of that place Mahanaim, that is, Camps.", "3": "And he sent messengers before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir to the country of Edom:", "4": "And he commanded them, saying: Thus shall ye speak to my lord Esau: Thus saith thy brother Jacob: I have sojourned with Laban, and have been with him until this day.", "5": "I have oxen, and asses, and sheep, and menservants, and womenservants: and now I send a message to my lord, that I may find favour in thy sight.", "6": "And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying: We came to Esau thy brother, and behold he cometh with speed to meet thee with four hundred men.", "7": "Then Jacob was greatly afraid; and in his fear divided the people that was with him, and the flocks, and the sheep, and the oxen, and the camels, into two companies,", "8": "Saying: If Esau come to one company and destroy it, the other company that is left shall escape.", "9": "And Jacob said: O God of my father Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, O Lord, who saidst to me: Return to thy land and to the place of thy birth, and I will do well for thee,", "10": "I am not worthy of the least of all thy mercies, and of thy truth which thou hast fulfilled to thy servant. With my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I return with two companies.", "11": "Deliver me from the hand of my brother Esau, for I am greatly afraid of him: lest perhaps he come, and kill the mother with the children.", "12": "Thou didst say that thou wouldst do well by me, and multiply my seed like the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.", "13": "And when he had slept there that night, he set apart, of the things which he had, presents for his brother Esau.", "14": "Two hundred she goats, twenty he goats, two hundred ewes, and twenty rams,", "15": "Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and twenty bulls, twenty she asses, and ten of their foals.", "16": "And he sent them by the hands of his servants, every drove by itself, and he said to his servants: Go before me, and let there be a space between drove and drove.", "17": "And he commanded the first, saying: If thou meet my brother Esau, and he ask thee: Whose art thou? or whither goest thou? or whose are these before thee?", "18": "Thou shalt answer: Thy servant Jacob's: he hath sent them as a present to my lord Esau: and he cometh after us.", "19": "In like manner he commanded the second and the third, and all that followed the droves, saying: Speak ye the same words to Esau, when ye find him.", "20": "And ye shall add: Thy servant Jacob himself also followeth after us: for he said: I will appease him with the presents that go before, and afterwards I will see him, perhaps he will be gracious to me.", "21": "So the presents went before him, but himself lodged that night in the camp.", "22": "And rising early he took his two wives, and his two handmaids, with his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of Jaboc.", "23": "And when all things were brought over that belonged to him,", "24": "He remained alone: and behold<u>a man</u>wrestled with him till morning.", "25": "And when he saw that he could not overcome him, he touched the sinew of his thigh, and forthwith it shrank.", "26": "And he said to him: Let me go, for it is break of day.

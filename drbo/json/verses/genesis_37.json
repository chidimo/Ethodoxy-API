{"Genesis__37": {"1": "And Jacob dwelt in the land of Chanaan wherein his father sojourned.", "2": "And these are his generations: Joseph, when he was sixteen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren, being but a boy: and he was with the sons of Bala and of Zelpha his father's wives: and he accused his brethren to his father of a most wicked crime.", "3": "Now Israel loved Joseph above all his sons, because he had him in his old age: and he made him a coat of divers colours.", "4": "And his brethren seeing that he was loved by his father, more than all his sons, hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.", "5": "Now it fell out also that he told his brethren<u>a dream</u>, that he had dreamed: which occasioned them to hate him the more.", "6": "And he said to them: Hear my dream which I dreamed.", "7": "I thought we were binding sheaves in the field: and my sheaf arose as it were, and stood, and your sheaves standing about, bowed down before my sheaf.", "8": "His brethren answered: Shalt thou be our king? or shall we be subject to thy dominion? Therefore this matter of his dreams and words ministered nourishment to their envy and hatred.", "9": "He dreamed also another dream, which he told his brethren, saying: I saw in a dream, as it were the sun, and the moon, and eleven stars worshipping me.", "10": "And when he had told this to his father and brethren, his father rebuked him, and said: What meaneth this dream that thou hast dreamed? shall I and thy mother, and thy brethren<u>worship</u>thee upon the earth?", "11": "His brethren therefore envied him: but his father considered the thing with himself.", "12": "And when his brethren abode in Sichem feeding their father's flocks,", "13": "Israel said to him: Thy brethren feed the sheep in Sichem: come, I will send thee to them. And when he answered:", "14": "I am ready: he said to him: Go, and see if all things be well with thy brethren, and the cattle: and bring me word again what is doing. So being sent from the vale of Hebron, he came to Sichem:", "15": "And a man found him there wandering in the field, and asked what he sought.", "16": "But he answered: I seek my brethren; tell me where they feed the flocks.", "17": "And the man said to him: They are departed from this place: for I heard them say: Let us go to Dothain. And Joseph went forward after his brethren, and found them in Dothain.", "18": "And when they saw him afar off, before he came nigh them, they thought to kill him.", "19": "And said one to another: Behold the dreamer cometh.", "20": "Come, let us kill him, and cast him into some old pit: and we will say: Some evil beast hath devoured him: and then it shall appear what his dreams avail him:", "21": "And Ruben hearing this, endeavoured to deliver him out of their hands, and said:", "22": "Do not take away his life, nor shed his blood: but cast him into this pit, that is in the wilderness, and keep your hands harmless: now he said this, being desirous to deliver him out of their hands and to restore him to his father.", "23": "And as soon as he came to his brethren, they forthwith stript him of his outside coat, that was of divers colours:", "24": "And cast him into an old pit, where there was no water.", "25": "And sitting down to eat bread, they saw some Ismaelites on their way coming from Galaad, with their camels, carrying spices, and balm, and myrrh to Egypt.", "26": "And Juda said to his brethren: What will it profit us to kill our brother, and conceal his blood?", "27": "It is better that he be sold to the Ismaelites, and that our hands be not defiled: for he is our brother and our flesh. His brethren agreed to his words.", "28": "And when the Madianite merchants passed by, they drew him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ismaelites, for twenty pieces of silver: and they led him into Egypt.", "29": "And Ruben, returning to the pit, found not the boy:", "30": "And rending his garments he went to his brethren, and said: The boy doth not appear and whither shall I go?", "31": "And they took his coat, and dipped it in the blood of a kid, which they had killed:", "32": "Sending some to carry it to their father, and to say: This we have found: see whether it be thy son's coat, or not.", "33": "And the father acknowledging it, said: It is my son's coat, an evil wild beast hath eaten him, a beast hath devoured Joseph.", "34": "And tearing his garments, he put on sackcloth, mourning for his son a long time.", "35": "And all his children being gathered together to comfort their father in his sorrow, he would not receive comfort, but said: I will go down to my son<u>into hell</u>, mourning. And whilst he continued weeping,", "36": "The Madianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Putiphar,<u>an eunuch</u>of Pharao, captain of the soldiers."}}

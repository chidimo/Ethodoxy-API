{"Genesis__40": {"1": "After this, it came to pass, that two eunuchs, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, offended their lord.", "2": "And Pharao being angry with them (now the one was chief butler, the other chief baker)", "3": "He sent them to the prison of the commander of the soldiers, in which Joseph also was prisoner,", "4": "But the keeper of the prison delivered them to Joseph, and he served them. Some little time passed, and they were kept in custody.", "5": "And they both dreamed a dream the same night, according to the interpretation agreeing to themselves:", "6": "And when Joseph was come in to them in the morning, and saw them sad,", "7": "He asked them, saying: Why is your countenance sadder today than usual?", "8": "They answered: We have dreamed a dream, and there is nobody to interpret it to us. And Joseph said to them:<u>Doth not interpretation belong to God</u>? Tell me what you have dreamed.", "9": "The chief butler first told his dream: I saw before me a vine,", "10": "On which were three branches, which by little and little sent out buds, and after the blossoms brought forth ripe grapes:", "11": "And the cup of Pharao was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into the cup which I held, and I gave the cup to Pharao.", "12": "Joseph answered: This is the interpretation of the dream: The three branches are yet three days:", "13": "After which Pharao will remember thy service, and will restore thee to thy former place: and thou shalt present him the cup according to thy office, as before thou wast wont to do.", "14": "Only remember me, when it shall be well with thee, and do me this kindness: to put Pharao in mind to take me out of this prison:", "15": "For I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here without any fault was cast into the dungeon.", "16": "The chief baker seeing that he had wisely interpreted the dream, said: I also dreamed a dream, That I had three baskets of meal upon my head:", "17": "And that in one basket which was uppermost, I carried all meats that are made by the art of baking, and that the birds ate out of it.", "18": "Joseph answered: This is the interpretation of the dream: The three baskets are yet three days:", "19": "After which Pharao will take thy head from thee, and hang thee on a cross, and the birds shall tear thy flesh.", "20": "The third day after this was the birthday of Pharao: and he made a great feast for his servants, and at the banquet remembered the chief butler, and the chief baker.", "21": "And he restored the one to his place to present him the cup:", "22": "The other he hanged on a gibbet, that the truth of the interpreter might be shewn.", "23": "But the chief butler, when things prospered with him, forgot his interpreter."}}

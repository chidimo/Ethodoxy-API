O Lord,<u>thy work</u>, in the midst of the years bring it to life: In the midst of the years thou shalt make it known: when thou art angry, thou wilt remember mercy.", "3": "<u>God will come from the south</u>, and the holy one from mount Pharan: His glory covered the heavens, and the earth is full of his praise.", "4": "His brightness shall be as the light;<u>horns</u>are in his hands: There is his strength hid:", "5": "<u>Death shall go before his face</u>. And the devil shall go forth before his feet.", "6": "He stood and measured the earth.<u>He beheld</u>, and melted the nations: and<u>the ancient mountains</u>were crushed to pieces. The hills of the world were bowed down by the journeys of his eternity.", "7": "I saw the tents of<u>Ethiopia</u>for their iniquity, the curtains of the land of Madian shall be troubled.", "8": "Wast thou angry, O Lord,<u>with the rivers</u>? or was thy wrath upon the rivers? or thy indignation in the sea? Who will ride upon thy horses: and thy chariots are salvation.", "9": "Thou wilt surely take up thy bow: according to the oaths which thou hast spoken to the tribes. Thou wilt divide the rivers of the earth.", "10": "The mountains saw thee, and were grieved: the great body of waters passed away.

Thou struckest<u>the head of the house of the wicked</u>: thou hast laid bare his foundation even to the neck.", "14": "Thou hast cursed his sceptres, the head of his warriors, them that came out as a whirlwind to scatter me. Their joy was like that of him that devoureth the poor man in secret.", "15": "<u>Thou madest a way in the sea</u>for thy horses, in the mud of many waters.", "16": "<u>I have heard</u>and my bowels were troubled: my lips trembled at the voice. Let rottenness enter into my bones, and swarm under me. That I may rest in the day of tribulation:<u>that I may go up to our people</u>that are girded.", "17": "For the fig tree shall not blossom: and there shall be no spring in the vines. The labour of the olive tree shall fail: and the fields shall yield no food: the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls.", "18": "But I will rejoice in the Lord: and I will joy in God my Jesus.", "19": "The Lord God is my strength: and he will make my feet like the feet of harts: and he the conqueror will lead me upon my high places singing psalms."}}

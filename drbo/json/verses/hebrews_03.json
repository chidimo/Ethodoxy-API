{"Hebrews__03": {"1": "Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly vocation, consider the apostle and high priest of our confession, Jesus:", "2": "Who is faithful to him that made him, as was also Moses in all his house.", "3": "For this man was counted worthy of greater glory than Moses, by so much as he that hath built the house, hath greater honour than the house.", "4": "For every house is built by some man: but he that created all things, is God.", "5": "And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be said:", "6": "But Christ as the Son in his own house: which house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and glory of hope unto the end.", "7": "Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith: Today if you shall hear his voice,", "8": "Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation; in the day of temptation in the desert,", "9": "Where your fathers tempted me, proved and saw my works,", "10": "Forty years: for which cause I was offended with this generation, and I said: They always err in heart. And they have not known my ways,", "11": "As I have sworn in my wrath: If they shall enter into my rest.", "12": "Take heed, brethren, lest perhaps there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, to depart from the living God.", "13": "But exhort one another every day, whilst it is called today, that none of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.", "14": "For we are made partakers of Christ: yet so, if we hold the beginning of his substance firm unto the end.", "15": "While it is said, Today if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in that provocation.", "16": "For some who heard did provoke: but not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.", "17": "And with whom was he offended forty years? Was it not with them that sinned, whose carcasses were overthrown in the desert?", "18": "And to whom did he swear, that they should not enter into his rest: but to them that were incredulous?", "19": "And we see that they could not enter in, because of unbelief."}}

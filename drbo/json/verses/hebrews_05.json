{"Hebrews__05": {"1": "For every high priest taken from among men, is ordained for men in the things that appertain to God, that he may offer up gifts and sacrifices for sins:", "2": "Who can have compassion on them that are ignorant and that err: because he himself also is compassed with infirmity.", "3": "And therefore he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.", "4": "Neither doth any man take the honour to himself, but he that is called by God, as Aaron was.", "5": "So Christ also did not glorify himself, that he might be made a high priest: but he that said unto him: Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.", "6": "As he saith also in another place: Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech.", "7": "Who in the days of his flesh, with a strong cry and tears, offering up prayers and supplications to him that was able to save him from death, was heard for his reverence.", "8": "And whereas indeed he was the Son of God, he learned obedience by the things which he suffered:", "9": "And being consummated, he became, to all that obey him, the cause of eternal salvation.", "10": "Called by God a high priest according to the order of Melchisedech.", "11": "Of whom we have much to say, and hard to be intelligibly uttered: because you are become weak to hear.", "12": "For whereas for the time you ought to be masters, you have need to be taught again what are the first elements of the words of God: and you are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat.", "13": "For every one that is a partaker of milk, is unskillful in the word of justice: for he is a little child.", "14": "But strong meat is for the perfect; for them who by custom have their senses exercised to the discerning of good and evil."}}

deserved.", "7": "Babylon hath been a golden cup in the hand of the Lord, that made all the earth drunk: the nations have drunk of her wine, and therefore they have staggered.", "8": "Babylon is suddenly fallen, and destroyed: howl for her, take balm for her pain, if so she may be healed.", "9": "We would have cured Babylon, but she is not healed: let us forsake her, and let us go every man

land: sound with the trumpet among the nations: prepare the nations against her: call together against her the kings of Ararat, Menni, and Ascenez: number Taphsar against her, bring the horse as the stinging locust.", "28": "Prepare the nations against her, the kings of Media, their captains, and all their rulers, and all the land of their dominion.", "29": "And the land shall be in a commotion, and shall be troubled: for the design of the Lord against Babylon shall awake, to make the land of Babylon desert and uninhabitable.", "30": "The valiant men of Babylon have forborne to fight, they have dwelt in holds: their strength hath failed, and they are become as women: her dwelling places are burnt, her bars are broken.", "31": "One running post shall meet another, and messenger shall meet messenger: to tell the king of Babylon that his city is taken from one end to the other:", "32": "And that the fords are taken, and the marshes are burnt with fire, and the men of war are affrighted.", "33": "For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: The daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, this is the time of her thrashing: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come.", "34": "Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon hath eaten me up, he hath devoured me: he hath made me as an empty vessel: he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly

{"Job__01": {"1": "There was a man in the land of<u>\n              Hus\n             </u>, whose name was Job, and that man was<u>\n              simple\n             </u>and upright, and fearing God, and avoiding evil.", "2": "And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters.", "3": "And his possession was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a family exceeding great: and this man was great among all the people of the east.", "4": "And his sons went,<u>\n              and made a feast by houses\n             </u>every one in his day. And sending they called their three sisters to eat and drink with them.", "5": "And when the days of their feasting were gone about, Job sent to them, and sanctified them: and rising up early offered holocausts for every one of them. For he said: Lest perhaps my sons have sinned, and have<u>\n              blessed\n             </u>God in their hearts. So did Job all days.", "6": "Now on a certain day when<u>\n              the sons of God\n             </u>came to stand before the Lord, Satan also was present among them.", "7": "And the Lord said to him: Whence comest thou? And he answered and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it.", "8": "And the Lord said to him: Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a simple and upright man, and fearing God, and avoiding evil?", "9": "And Satan answering, said: Doth Job fear God in vain?", "10": "Hast not thou made a fence for him, and his house, and all his substance round about, blessed the works of his hands, and his possession hath increased on the earth?", "11": "But stretch forth thy hand a little, and touch all that he hath, and see if he blesseth thee not to thy face.", "12": "Then the Lord said to Satan: Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand: only put not forth thy hand upon his person. And Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.", "13": "Now upon a certain day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother,", "14": "There came a messenger to Job, and said: The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them,", "15": "And the Sabeans rushed in, and took all away, and slew the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.", "16": "And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said: The fire of God fell from heaven, and striking the sheep and the servants, hath consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.", "17": "And while he also was yet speaking, there came another, and said: The Chaldeans made three troops, and have fallen upon the camels, and taken them, moreover they have slain the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.", "18": "He was yet speaking, and behold another came in, and said: Thy sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their elder brother:", "19": "A violent wind came on a sudden from the side of the desert, and shook the four corners of the house, and it fell upon thy children and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to tell thee.", "20": "Then Job rose up, and rent his garments, and having shaven his head fell down upon the ground and worshipped,", "21": "And said: Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: as it hath pleased the Lord so is it done: blessed be the name of the Lord.", "22": "In all these things Job sinned not by his lips, nor spoke he any foolish thing against God."}}

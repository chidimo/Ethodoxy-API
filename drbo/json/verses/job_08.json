{"Job__08": {"1": "The Baldad the Suhite answered, and said:", "2": "How long wilt thou speak these things, and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?", "3": "Doth God pervert judgment, or doth the Almighty overthrow that which is just?", "4": "Although thy children have sinned against him, and he hath left them in the hand of their iniquity:", "5": "Yet if thou wilt arise early to God, and wilt beseech the Almighty:", "6": "If thou wilt walk clean and upright, he will presently awake onto thee, and will make the dwelling of thy justice peaceable:", "7": "Insomuch, that if thy former things were small, thy latter things would be multiplied exceedingly.", "8": "For inquire of the former generation, and search diligently into the memory of the fathers:", "9": "(For we are but of yesterday, and are ignorant that our days upon earth are but a shadow:)", "10": "And they shall teach thee: they shall speak to thee, and utter words out of their hearts.", "11": "Can the rush be green without moisture? or a sedge-bush grow without water?", "12": "When it is yet in flower, and is not plucked up with the hand, it withereth before all herbs.", "13": "Even so are the ways of all that forget God, and the hope of the hypocrite shall perish:", "14": "His folly shall not please him, and his trust shall be like the spider's web.", "15": "He shall lean upon his house, and it shall not stand: he shall prop it up, and it shall not rise:", "16": "He seemeth to have moisture before the sun cometh, and at his rising his blossom shall shoot forth.", "17": "His roots shall be thick upon a heap of stones, and among the stones he shall abide.", "18": "If one swallow him up out of his place, he shall deny him, and shall say: I know thee not.", "19": "For this is the joy of his way, that others may spring again out of the earth.", "20": "God will not cast away the simple, nor reach out his hand to the evildoer:", "21": "Until thy mouth be filled with laughter, and thy lips with rejoicing.", "22": "They that hate thee, shall be clothed with confusion: and the dwelling of the wicked shall not stand."}}

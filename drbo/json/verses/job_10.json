{"Job__10": {"1": "My soul is weary of my life, I will let go my speech against myself, I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.", "2": "I will say to God: Do not condemn me: tell me why thou judgest me so.", "3": "Doth it seem good to thee that thou shouldst calumniate me, and oppress me, the work of thy own hands, and help the counsel of the wicked?", "4": "Hast thou eyes of flesh: or, shalt thou see as man seeth?", "5": "Are thy days as the days of man, and are thy years as the times of men:", "6": "That thou shouldst inquire after my iniquity, and search after my sin?", "7": "And shouldst know that I have done no wicked thing, whereas there is no man that can deliver out of thy hand.", "8": "Thy hands have made me, and fashioned me wholly round about, and dost thou thus cast me down headlong on a sudden?", "9": "Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay, and thou wilt bring me into dust again.", "10": "Hast thou not milked me as milk, and curdled me like cheese?", "11": "Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh: thou hast put me together with bones and sinews:", "12": "Thou hast granted me life and mercy, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.", "13": "Although thou conceal these things in thy heart, yet I know that thou rememberest all things.", "14": "If I have sinned and thou hast spared me for an hour: why dost thou not suffer me to be clean from my iniquity?", "15": "And if I be wicked, woe unto me: and if just, I shall not lift up my head, being filled with affliction and misery.", "16": "And for pride thou wilt take me as a lioness, and returning thou tormentest me wonderfully.", "17": "Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and multipliest thy wrath upon me, and pains war against me.", "18": "Why didst thou bring me forth out of the womb: O that I had been consumed that eye might not see me!", "19": "I should have been as if I had not been, carried from the womb to the grave.", "20": "Shall not the fewness of my days be ended shortly? suffer me, therefore, that I may lament my sorrow a little:", "21": "Before I go, and return no more, to a land that is dark and covered with the mist of death:", "22": "A land of misery and darkness, where the shadow of death, and no order, but everlasting horror dwelleth."}}

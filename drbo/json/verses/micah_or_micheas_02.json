{"Micah or Micheas__02": {"1": "Woe to you that devise that which is unprofitable, and work evil in your beds: in the morning light they execute it, because their hand is against God.", "2": "And they have coveted fields, and taken them by violence, and houses they have forcibly taken away: and oppressed a man and his house, a man and his inheritance.", "3": "Therefore thus saith the Lord: Behold, I devise an evil against this family: from which you shall not withdraw your necks, and you shall not walk haughtily, for this is a very evil time.", "4": "In that day a parable shall be taken up upon you, and a song shall be sung with melody by them that say: We are laid waste and spoiled: the portion of my people is changed:<u>how shall he depart</u>from me, whereas he is returning that will divide our land?", "5": "Therefore<u>thou shalt have none</u>that shall cast the cord of a lot in the assembly of the Lord.", "6": "Speak ye not, saying:<u>It shall not drop</u>upon these, confusion shall not take them.", "7": "The house of Jacob saith: Is the spirit of the Lord straitened, or are these his thoughts? Are not my words good to him that walketh uprightly?", "8": "But my people, on the contrary, are risen up as an enemy:<u>you have taken away</u>the cloak off from the coat: and them that passed harmless you have turned to war.", "9": "<u>You have cast out</u>the women of my people from their houses, in which they took delight: you have taken my praise for ever from their children.", "10": "Arise ye, and depart, for there is no rest here for you. For that uncleanness of the land, it shall be corrupted with a grievous corruption.", "11": "<u>Would God</u>I were not a man that hath the spirit, and that I rather spoke a lie: I will let drop to thee of wine, and of drunkenness: and it shall be this people upon whom it shall drop.", "12": "I will assemble and gather together all of thee, O Jacob: I will bring together the remnant of Israel, I will put them together as a flock in the fold, as the sheep in the midst of the sheepcotes, they shall make a tumult by reason of the multitude of men.", "13": "For he shall go up that shall open the way before them: they shall divide, and pass through the gate, and shall come in by it: and their king shall pass before them, and the Lord at the head of them."}}

{"Proverbs__25": {"1": "These are also parables of Solomon, which the men of Ezechias king of Juda copied out.", "2": "It is the glory of God to conceal the word, and the glory of kings to search out the speech.", "3": "The heaven above, and the earth beneath, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.", "4": "Take away the rust from silver, and there shall come forth a most pure vessel:", "5": "Take away wickedness from the face of the king, and his throne shall be established with justice.", "6": "Appear not glorious before the king, and stand not in the place of great men.", "7": "For it is better that it should be said to thee: Come up hither; than that thou shouldst be humbled before the prince.", "8": "The things which thy eyes have seen, utter not hastily in a quarrel: lest afterward thou mayst not be able to make amends, when thou hast dishonoured thy friend.", "9": "Treat thy cause with thy friend, and discover not the secret to a stranger:", "10": "Lest he insult over thee, when he hath heard it, and cease not to upbraid thee. Grace and friendship deliver a man: keep these for thyself, lest thou fall under reproach.", "11": "To speak a word in due time, is like apples of gold on beds of silver.", "12": "As an earring of gold and a bright pearl, so is he that reproveth the wise, and the obedient ear.", "13": "As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to him that sent him, for he refresheth his soul.", "14": "As clouds, and wind, when no rain followeth, so is the man that boasteth, and doth not fulfill his promises.", "15": "By patience a prince shall be appeased, and a soft tongue shall break hardness.", "16": "Thou hast found honey, eat what is sufficient for thee, lest being glutted therewith thou vomit it up.", "17": "Withdraw thy foot from the house of thy neighbour, lest having his fill he hate thee.", "18": "A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour, is like a dart and a sword and a sharp arrow.", "19": "To trust to an unfaithful man in the time of trouble, is like a rotten tooth, and weary foot,", "20": "And one that looseth his garment in cold weather. As vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to a very evil heart. As a moth doth by a garment, and a worm by the wood: so the sadness of a man consumeth the heart.", "21": "If thy enemy be hungry, give him to eat: if he thirst, give him water to drink:", "22": "For thou shalt heap hot coals upon his head, and the Lord will reward thee.", "23": "The north wind driveth away rain, as doth a sad countenance a backbiting tongue.", "24": "It is better to sit in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman, and in a common house.", "25": "As cold water to a thirsty soul, so is good tidings from a far country.", "26": "A just man falling down before the wicked, is as a fountain troubled with the foot, and a corrupted spring.", "27": "As it is not good for a man to eat much honey, so he that is a searcher of<u>\n                majesty\n               </u>, shall be overwhelmed by glory.", "28": "As a city that lieth open and is not compassed with walls, so is a man that cannot refrain his own spirit in speaking."}}

{"Psalms__126": {"1": "Unless the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it. Unless the Lord keep the city, he watcheth in vain that keepeth it.", "2": "<u>\n                It is vain for you to rise before light\n               </u>, rise ye after you have sitten, you that eat the bread of sorrow. When he shall give sleep to his beloved,", "3": "Behold the inheritance of the Lord are children: the reward, the fruit of the womb.", "4": "As arrows in the hand of the mighty, so the children of them that have been shaken.", "5": "Blessed is the man that hath filled the desire with them; he shall not be confounded when he shall speak to his enemies in the gate."}}

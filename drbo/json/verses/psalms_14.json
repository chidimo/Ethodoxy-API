{"Psalms__14": {"1": "A psalm of David. Lord, who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? or who shall rest in thy holy hill?", "2": "He that walketh without blemish, and worketh justice:", "3": "He that speaketh truth in his heart, who hath not used deceit in his tongue: Nor hath done evil to his neighbour: nor taken up a reproach against his neighbours.", "4": "In his sight the malignant is brought to nothing: but he glorifieth them that fear the Lord. He that sweareth to his neighbour, and deceiveth not;", "5": "He that hath not put out his money to usury, nor taken bribes against the innocent: He that doth these things shall not be moved for ever."}}

{"Psalms__140": {"1": "I have cried to the, O Lord, hear me: hearken to my voice, when I cry to thee.", "2": "Let my prayer be directed as incense in thy sight; the lifting up of my hands, as evening sacrifice.", "3": "Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth: and a door round about my lips.", "4": "Incline not my heart to evil words; to make excuses in sins. With men that work iniquity: and I will not communicate with the choicest of them.", "5": "The just shall correct me in mercy, and shall reprove me: but<u>\n                let not the oil of the sinner\n               </u>fatten my head.<u>\n                For my prayer\n               </u>also shall still be against the things with which they are well pleased:", "6": "<u>\n                Their judges\n               </u>falling upon the rock have been swallowed up. They shall hear my words, for they have prevailed:", "7": "As when the thickness of the earth is broken up upon the ground: Our bones are scattered by the side of hell.", "8": "But o to thee, O Lord, Lord, are my eyes: in thee have I put my trust, take not away my soul.", "9": "Keep me from the snare, which they have laid for me, and from the stumblingblocks of them that work iniquity.", "10": "The wicked shall fall in his net:<u>\n                I am alone\n               </u>until I pass."}}

He hath led me on the paths of justice, for his own name's sake.", "4": "For though I should walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I will fear no evils, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they have comforted me.", "5": "Thou hast prepared a table before me against them that afflict me.

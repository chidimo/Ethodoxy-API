{"Psalms__31": {"1": "To David himself, understanding. Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.", "2": "Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin, and in whose spirit there is no guile.", "3": "<u>\n                Because I was silent\n               </u>my bones grew old; whilst I cried out all the day long.", "4": "For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me:<u>\n                I am turned\n               </u>in my anguish, whilst the thorn is fastened.", "5": "I have acknowledged my sin to thee, and my injustice I have not concealed. I said I will confess against myself my injustice to the Lord: and thou hast forgiven the wickedness of my sin.", "6": "For this shall every one that is holy pray to thee in a seasonable time. And yet in a flood of many waters, they shall not come nigh unto him.", "7": "Thou art my refuge from the trouble which hath encompassed me: my joy, deliver me from them that surround me.", "8": "I will give thee understanding, and I will instruct thee in this way, in which thou shalt go: I will fix my eyes upon thee.", "9": "Do not become like the horse and the mule, who have no understanding. With bit and bridle bind fast their jaws, who come not near unto thee.", "10": "Many are the scourges of the sinner, but mercy shall encompass him that hopeth in the Lord.", "11": "Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye just, and glory, all ye right of heart."}}

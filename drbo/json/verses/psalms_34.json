{"Psalms__34": {"1": "For David himself. Judge thou, O Lord, them that wrong me: overthrow them that fight against me.", "2": "Take hold of arms and shield: and rise up to help me.", "3": "Bring out the sword, and shut up the way against them that persecute me: say to my soul: I am thy salvation.", "4": "Let them be confounded and ashamed that seek after my soul. Let them be turned back and be confounded that devise against me.", "5": "Let them become as dust before the wind: and let the angel of the Lord straiten them.", "6": "Let their way become dark and slippery; and let the angel of the Lord pursue them.", "7": "For without cause they have hidden their net for me unto destruction: without cause they have upbraided my soul.", "8": "Let the snare which he knoweth not come upon him: and let the net which he hath hidden catch him: and let the net which he hath hidden catch him: and into that very snare let them fall.", "9": "But my soul shall rejoice in the Lord; and shall be delighted in his salvation.", "10": "All my bones shall say: Lord, who is like to thee? Who deliverest the poor from the hand of them that are stronger than he; the needy and the poor from them that strip him.", "11": "Unjust witnesses rising up have asked me things I knew not.", "12": "They repaid me evil for good: to the depriving me of my soul.", "13": "But as for me, when they were troublesome to me, I was clothed with haircloth. I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer shall be turned into my bosom.", "14": "As a neighbour and as an own brother, so did I please: as one mourning and sorrowful so was I humbled.", "15": "But they rejoiced against me, and came together: scourges were gathered together upon me, and I knew not.", "16": "They were separated, and repented not: they tempted me, they scoffed at me with scorn: they gnashed upon me with their teeth.", "17": "Lord, when wilt thou look upon me? rescue thou my soul from their malice: my only one from the lions.", "18": "I will give thanks to thee in a great church; I will praise thee in a strong people.", "19": "Let not them that are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: who have hated me without cause, and wink with the eyes.", "20": "For they spoke indeed peaceably to me; and speaking in the anger of the earth they devised guile.", "21": "And they opened their mouth wide against me; they said: Well done, well done, our eyes have seen it.", "22": "Thou hast seen, O Lord, be not thou silent: O Lord, depart not from me.", "23": "Arise, and be attentive to my judgment: to my cause, my God, and my Lord.", "24": "Judge me, O Lord my God according to thy justice, and let them not rejoice over me.", "25": "Let them not say in their hearts: It is well, it is well, to our mind: neither let them say: We have swallowed him up.", "26": "Let them blush: and be ashamed together, who rejoice at my evils. Let them be clothed with confusion and shame, who speak great things against me.", "27": "Let them rejoice and be glad, who are well pleased with my justice, and let them say always: The Lord be magnified, who delights in the peace of his servant.", "28": "And my tongue shall meditate thy justice, thy praise all the day long."}}

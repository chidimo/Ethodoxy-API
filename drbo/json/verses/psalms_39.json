{"Psalms__39": {"1": "Unto the end, a psalm for David himself.", "2": "With expectation I have waited for the Lord, and he was attentive to me.", "3": "And he heard my prayers, and brought me out of the pit of misery and the mire of dregs. And he set my feet upon a rock, and directed my steps.", "4": "And he put a new canticle into my mouth, a song to our God. Many shall see, and shall fear: and they shall hope in the Lord.", "5": "Blessed is the man whose trust is in the name of the Lord; and who hath not had regard to vanities, and lying follies.", "6": "Thou hast multiplied thy wonderful works, O Lord my God: and in thy thoughts there is no one like to thee. I have declared and I have spoken they are multiplied above number.", "7": "Sacrifice and oblation thou didst not desire; but thou hast pierced ears for me. Burnt offering and sin offering thou didst not require:", "8": "Then said I, Behold I come. In the head of the book it is written of me", "9": "That I should do thy will: O my God, I have desired it, and thy law in the midst of my heart.", "10": "I have declared thy justice in a great church, lo, I will not restrain my lips: O Lord, thou knowest it.", "11": "I have not hid thy justice within my heart: I have declared thy truth and thy salvation. I have not concealed thy mercy and thy truth from a great council.", "12": "Withhold not thou, O Lord, thy tender mercies from me: thy mercy and thy truth have always upheld me.", "13": "For evils without number have surrounded me;<u>\n                my iniquities\n               </u>have overtaken me, and I was not able to see. They are multiplied above the hairs of my head: and my heart hath forsaken me.", "14": "Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me, look down, O Lord, to help me.", "15": "Let them be confounded and ashamed together, that seek after my soul to take it away. Let them be turned backward and be ashamed that desire evils to me.", "16": "Let them immediately bear their confusion, that say to me:<u>\n                Tis well\n               </u>, tis well.", "17": "Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say always: The Lord be magnified.", "18": "But I am a beggar and poor: the Lord is careful for me. Thou art my helper and my protector: O my God, be not slack."}}

{"Psalms__52": {"1": "Unto the end, for<u>\n                Maeleth\n               </u>, understandings to David. The fool said in his heart: There is no God.", "2": "They are corrupted, and become abominable in iniquities: there is none that doth good.", "3": "God looked down from heaven on the children of men: to see if there were any that did understand, or did seek God.", "4": "All have gone aside, they are become unprofitable together, there is none that doth good, no not one.", "5": "Shall not all the workers of iniquity know, who eat up my people as they eat bread?", "6": "They have not called upon God: there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear. For<u>\n                God hath scattered the bones\n               </u>of them that please men: they have been confounded, because God hath despised them.", "7": "Who will give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? when God shall bring back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad."}}

{"Psalms__54": {"1": "Unto the end, in verses, understanding for David.", "2": "Hear, O God, my prayer, and despise not my supplication:", "3": "Be attentive to me and hear me. I am grieved in my exercise; and am troubled,", "4": "At the voice of the enemy, and at the tribulation of the sinner. For they have cast iniquities upon me: and in wrath they were troublesome to me.", "5": "My heart is troubled within me: and the fear of death is fallen upon me.", "6": "Fear and trembling are come upon me: and darkness hath covered me.", "7": "And I said: Who will give me wings like a dove, and I will fly and be at rest?", "8": "Lo, I have gone far off flying away; and I abode in the wilderness.", "9": "I waited for him that hath saved me from pusillanimity of spirit, and a storm.", "10": "Cast down, O Lord, and divide their tongues; for I have seen iniquity and contradiction in the city.", "11": "Day and night shall iniquity surround it upon its walls: and in the midst thereof are labour,", "12": "And injustice. And usury and deceit have not departed from its streets.", "13": "For if my enemy had reviled me, I would verily have borne with it. And if he that hated me had spoken great things against me, I would perhaps have hidden myself from him.", "14": "But thou a man of one mind, my guide, and my familiar,", "15": "Who didst take sweetmeats together with me: in the house of God we walked with consent.", "16": "<u>\n                Let death\n               </u>come upon them, and let them go down alive into hell. For there is wickedness in their dwellings: in the midst of them.", "17": "But I have cried to God: and the Lord will save me.", "18": "Evening and morning, and at noon I will speak and declare: and he shall hear my voice.", "19": "He shall redeem my soul in peace from them that draw near to me: for<u>\n                among many\n               </u>they were with me.", "20": "God shall hear, and the Eternal shall humble them. For there is no change with them, and they have not feared God:", "21": "He hath stretched forth his hand to repay. They have defiled his covenant,", "22": "<u>\n                They are divided\n               </u>by the wrath Of his countenance, and his heart hath drawn near. His words are smoother than oil, and the same are darts.", "23": "Cast thy care upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: he shall not suffer the just to waver for ever.", "24": "But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction. Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee, O Lord."}}

As they have waited for my soul,", "8": "<u>\n                For nothing shalt thou save them\n               </u>: in thy anger thou shalt break the people in pieces, O God,", "9": "I have declared to thee my life: thou hast set my tears in thy sight, As also in thy promise.", "10": "Then shall my enemies be turned back. In what day soever I shall call upon thee, behold I know thou art my God.", "11": "In God will I praise the word, in the Lord will I praise his speech.

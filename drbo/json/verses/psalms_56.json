{"Psalms__56": {"1": "Unto the end,<u>\n                destroy not\n               </u>, for David, for an inscription of a title, when he fled from Saul into the cave. [1 Kings 24]", "2": "Have mercy on me, O God, have mercy on me: for my soul trusteth in thee. And in the shadow of thy wings will I hope, until iniquity pass away.", "3": "I will cry to God the most High; to God who hath done good to me.", "4": "He hath sent from heaven and delivered me: he hath made them a reproach that trod upon me. God hath sent his mercy and his truth,", "5": "And he hath delivered my soul from the midst of the young lions. I slept troubled. The sons of men, whose teeth are weapons and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.", "6": "Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens, and thy glory above all the earth.", "7": "They prepared a snare for my feet; and they bowed down my soul. They dug a pit before my face, and they are fallen into it.", "8": "My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready: I will Sing, and rehearse a psalm.", "9": "Arise, O my glory, arise psaltery and harp: I will arise early.", "10": "I will give praise to thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing a psalm to thee among the nations.", "11": "For thy mercy is magnified even to the heavens: and thy truth unto the clouds.", "12": "Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth."}}

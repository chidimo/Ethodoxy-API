{"Psalms__89": {"1": "A prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, thou hast been our refuge from generation to generation.", "2": "Before the mountains were made, or the earth and the world was formed; from eternity and to eternity thou art God.", "3": "<u>\n                Turn not man away\n               </u>to be brought low: and thou hast said: Be converted, O ye sons of men.", "4": "For a thousand years in thy sight are as yesterday, which is past. And as a watch in the night,", "5": "Things that are counted nothing, shall their years be.", "6": "In the morning man shall grow up like grass; in the morning he shall flourish and pass away: in the evening he shall fall, grow dry, and wither.", "7": "For in thy wrath we have fainted away: and are troubled in thy indignation.", "8": "Thou hast set our iniquities before thy eyes: our life in the light of thy countenance.", "9": "For all our days are spent; and in thy wrath we have fainted away. Our years shall be considered<u>\n                as a spider\n               </u>:", "10": "The days of our years in them are threescore and ten years. But if in the strong they be fourscore years: and what is more of them is labour and sorrow. For<u>\n                mildness is come upon us\n               </u>: and we shall be corrected.", "11": "Who knoweth the power of thy anger, and for thy fear", "12": "Can number thy wrath?

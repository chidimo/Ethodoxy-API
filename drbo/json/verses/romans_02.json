{"Romans__02": {"1": "Wherefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest. For wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself. For thou dost the same things which thou judgest.", "2": "For we know that the judgment of God is, according to truth, against them that do such things.", "3": "And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them who do such things, and dost the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?", "4": "Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and patience, and longsuffering? Knowest thou not, that the benignity of God leadeth thee to penance?", "5": "But according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou treasurest up to thyself wrath, against the day of wrath, and revelation of the just judgment of God.", "6": "Who will render to every man according to his works.", "7": "To them indeed, who according to patience in good work, seek glory and honour and incorruption, eternal life:", "8": "But to them that are contentious, and who obey not the truth, but give credit to iniquity, wrath and indignation.", "9": "Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek.", "10": "But glory, and honour, and peace to every one that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.", "11": "For there is no respect of persons with God.", "12": "For whosoever have sinned without the law, shall perish without the law; and whosoever have sinned in the law, shall be judged by the law.", "13": "For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.", "14": "For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature those things that are of the law; these having not the law are a law to themselves:", "15": "Who shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness to them, and their thoughts between themselves accusing, or also defending one another,", "16": "In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.", "17": "But if thou art called a Jew and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God,", "18": "And knowest his will, and approvest the more profitable things, being instructed by the law,", "19": "Art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness,", "20": "An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law.", "21": "Thou therefore that teachest another, teachest not thyself: thou that preachest that men should not steal, stealest:", "22": "Thou that sayest, men should not commit adultery, committest adultery: thou that abhorrest idols, committest sacrilege:", "23": "Thou that makest thy boast of the law, by transgression of the law dishonourest God.", "24": "(For the name of God through you is blasphemed among the Gentiles, as it is written.)", "25": "Circumcision profiteth indeed, if thou keep the law; but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision.", "26": "If, then, the uncircumcised keep the justices of the law, shall not this uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?", "27": "And shall not that which by nature is uncircumcision, if it fulfill the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law?", "28": "For it is not he is a Jew, who is so outwardly; nor is that circumcision which is outwardly in the flesh:", "29": "But he is a Jew, that is one inwardly; and the circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God."}}

{"Romans__03": {"1": "What advantage then hath the Jew, or what is the profit of circumcision?", "2": "Much every way. First indeed, because the words of God were committed to them.", "3": "For what if some of them have not believed? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? God forbid.", "4": "But<u>\n                God is true\n               </u>; and every man a liar, as it is written, That thou mayest be justified in thy words, and mayest overcome when thou art judged.", "5": "But if our injustice commend the justice of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust, who executeth wrath?", "6": "(I speak according to man.) God forbid: otherwise how shall God judge this world?", "7": "For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie, unto his glory, why am I also yet judged as a sinner?", "8": "And not rather (as we are slandered, and as some affirm that we say) let us do evil, that there may come good? whose damnation is just.", "9": "What then? Do we excel them? No, not so. For we have charged both Jews, and Greeks, that they are all under sin.", "10": "As it is written:<u>\n                There is not any man just\n               </u>.", "11": "There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.", "12": "All have turned out of the way; they are become unprofitable together: there is none that doth good, there is not so much as one.", "13": "Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have dealt deceitfully. The venom of asps is under their lips.", "14": "Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:", "15": "Their feet swift to shed blood:", "16": "Destruction and misery in their ways:", "17": "And the way of peace they have not known:", "18": "There is no fear of God before their eyes.", "19": "Now we know, that what things soever the law speaketh, it speaketh to them that are in the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be made subject to God.", "20": "Because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before him. For by the law is the knowledge of sin.", "21": "But now without the law the justice of God is made manifest, being witnessed by the law and the prophets.", "22": "Even the justice of God, by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all them that believe in him: for there is no distinction:", "23": "For all have sinned, and do need the glory of God.", "24": "Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption, that is in Christ Jesus,", "25": "Whom God hath proposed to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to the shewing of his justice, for the remission of former sins,", "26": "Through the forbearance of God, for the shewing of his justice in this time; that he himself may be just, and the justifier of him, who is of the faith of Jesus Christ.", "27": "Where is then thy boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith.", "28": "For we account a man to be justified<u>\n                by faith\n               </u>, without the works of the law.", "29": "Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also.", "30": "For it is one God, that justifieth circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.", "31": "Do we, then, destroy the law through faith? God forbid: but we establish the law."}}

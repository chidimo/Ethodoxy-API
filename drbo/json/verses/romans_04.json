{"Romans__04": {"1": "What shall we say then that Abraham hath found, who is our father according to the flesh.", "2": "For if Abraham were justified<u>\n                by works\n               </u>, he hath whereof to glory, but<u>\n                not before God\n               </u>.", "3": "For what saith the scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was<u>\n                reputed\n               </u>to him unto justice.", "4": "Now<u>\n                to him that worketh\n               </u>, the reward is not reckoned according to grace, but according to debt.", "5": "But to him that worketh not, yet believeth in him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is reputed to justice, according to the purpose of the grace of God.", "6": "As David also termeth the blessedness of a man, to whom God reputeth justice without works:", "7": "Blessed are they<u>\n                whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered\n               </u>.", "8": "Blessed is the man to whom<u>\n                the Lord hath not imputed sin\n               </u>.", "9": "This blessedness then, doth it remain<u>\n                in the circumcision\n               </u>only, or in the uncircumcision also? For we say that unto Abraham faith was reputed to justice.", "10": "How then was it reputed? When he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.", "11": "And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the justice of the faith, which he had, being uncircumcised; that he might be the father of all them that believe, being uncircumcised, that unto them also it may be reputed to justice:", "12": "And might be the father of circumcision; not to them only, that are of the circumcision, but to them also that follow the steps of the faithful, that is in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham.", "13": "For not through the law was the promise to Abraham, or to his seed, that he should be heir of the world; but through the justice of faith.", "14": "For if they who are of the law<u>\n                be heirs\n               </u>, faith is made void, the promise is made of no effect.", "15": "For<u>\n                the law worketh wrath\n               </u>. For where there is no law, neither is there transgression.", "16": "Therefore is it of faith, that according to grace the promise might be firm to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,", "17": "(As it is written: I have made thee a father of many nations,) before God, whom he believed, who quickeneth the dead; and calleth those things that are not, as those that are.", "18": "Who against hope believed in hope; that he might be made the father of many nations, according to that which was said to him: So shall thy seed be.", "19": "And he was not weak in faith; neither did he consider his own body now dead, whereas he was almost an hundred years old, nor the dead womb of Sara.", "20": "In the promise also of God he staggered not by distrust; but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God:", "21": "Most fully knowing, that whatsoever he has promised, he is able also to perform.", "22": "And therefore it was reputed to him unto justice.", "23": "Now it is not written only for him, that it was reputed to him unto justice,", "24": "But also for us, to whom it shall be reputed, if we believe in him, that raised up Jesus Christ, our Lord, from the dead,", "25": "Who was delivered up for our sins, and rose again for our justification."}}

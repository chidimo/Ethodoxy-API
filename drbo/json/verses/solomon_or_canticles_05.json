{"Solomon or Canticles__05": {"1": "<u>Let my beloved come into his garden</u>, and eat the fruit of his apple trees. I am come into my garden, O my sister, my spouse, I have gathered my myrrh, with my aromatical spices: I have eaten the honeycomb with my honey, I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends, and drink, and be inebriated, my dearly beloved.", "2": "I sleep, and my heart watcheth; the voice of my beloved knocking: Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is full of dew, and my locks of the drops of the nights.", "3": "I have put off my garment, how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them?", "4": "<u>My beloved put his hand through the key hole</u>, and my bowels were moved at his touch.", "5": "I arose up to open to my beloved: my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers were full of the choicest myrrh.", "6": "I opened the bolt of my door to my beloved: but he had turned aside, and was gone. My soul melted when he spoke: I sought him, and found him not: I called, and he did not answer me.", "7": "The keepers that go about the city found me: they struck me: and wounded me: the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.", "8": "I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him that I languish with love.", "9": "What manner of one is thy beloved of the beloved, O thou most beautiful among women? what manner of one is thy beloved of the beloved, that thou hast so adjured us?", "10": "<u>My beloved</u>is white and ruddy, chosen out of thousands.", "11": "His head is as the finest gold: his locks as branches of palm trees, black as a raven.", "12": "His eyes as doves upon brooks of waters, which are washed with milk, and sit beside the plentiful streams.", "13": "His cheeks are as beds of aromatical spices set by the perfumers. His lips are as lilies dropping choice myrrh.", "14": "His hands are turned and as of gold, full of hyacinths. His belly as of ivory, set with sapphires.", "15": "His legs as pillars of marble, that are set upon bases of gold. His form as of Libanus, excellent as the cedars.", "16": "His throat most sweet, and he is all lovely: such is my beloved, and he is my friend, O ye daughters of Jerusalem.", "17": "Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou most beautiful among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside, and we will seek him with thee?"}}

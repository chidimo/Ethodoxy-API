Thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from Galaad.", "5": "Thy teeth as a flock of sheep, which come up from the washing, all with twins, and there is none barren among them.", "6": "Thy cheeks are as the bark of a pomegranate, beside what is hidden within thee.", "7": "There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and young maidens without number.", "8": "<u>One is my dove</u>, my perfect one is but one, she is the only one of her mother, the chosen of her that bore her. The daughters saw her, and declared her most blessed: the queens and concubines, and they praised her.", "9": "<u>Who is she</u>that cometh forth as the morning rising, fair as the moon, bright as the sun, terrible as an army set in array?", "10": "I went down into the garden of nuts, to see the fruits of the valleys, and to look if the vineyard had flourished, and the pomegranates budded.", "11": "I knew not: my soul troubled me for the chariots of Aminadab.", "12": "Return, return, O Sulamitess: return, return that we may behold thee."}}

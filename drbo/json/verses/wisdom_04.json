{"Wisdom *__04": {"1": "O how beautiful is the chaste generation with glory: for the memory thereof is immortal: because it is known both with God and with men.", "2": "When it is present, they imitate it: and they desire it when it hath withdrawn itself, and it triumpheth crowned for ever, winning the reward of undefiled conflicts.", "3": "But the multiplied brood of the wicked shall not thrive, and bastard slips shall not take deep root, nor any fast foundation.", "4": "And if they flourish in branches for a time, yet standing not fast, they shall be shaken with the wind, and through the force of winds they shall be rooted out.", "5": "For the branches not being perfect, shall be broken, and their fruits shall be unprofitable, and sour to eat, and fit for nothing.", "6": "For the children that are born of unlawful beds, are witnesses of wickedness against their parents in their trial.", "7": "But the just man, if he be prevented with death, shall be in rest.", "8": "For venerable old age is not that of long time, nor counted by the number of years: but the understanding of a man is grey hairs.", "9": "And a spotless life is old age.", "10": "He pleased God and was beloved, and living among sinners he was translated.", "11": "He was taken away lest wickedness should alter his understanding, or deceit beguile his soul.", "12": "For the bewitching of vanity obscureth good things, and the wandering of concupiscence overturneth the innocent mind.", "13": "Being made perfect in a short space, he fulfilled a long time:", "14": "For his soul pleased God: therefore he hastened to bring him out of the midst of iniquities: but the people see this, and understand not, nor lay up such things in their hearts:", "15": "That the grace of God, and his mercy is with his saints, and that he hath respect to his chosen.", "16": "But the just that is dead, condemneth the wicked that are living, and youth soon ended, the long life of the unjust.", "17": "For they shall see the end of the wise man, and shall not understand what God hath designed for him, and why the Lord hath set him in safety.", "18": "They shall see him, and shall despise him: but the Lord shall laugh them to scorn.", "19": "And they shall fall after this without honour, and be a reproach among the dead for ever: for he shall burst them puffed up and speechless, and shall shake them from the foundations, and they shall be utterly laid waste: they shall be in sorrow, and their memory shall perish.", "20": "They shall come with fear at the thought of their sins, and their iniquities shall stand against them to convict them."}}

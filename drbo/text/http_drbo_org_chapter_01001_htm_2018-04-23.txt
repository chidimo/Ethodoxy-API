             And the earth was void and empty, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the spirit of God moved over the waters.

              [4]

             And God saw the light that it was good; and he divided the light from the darkness.

              [5]

             made amidst the waters: and let it divide the waters from the waters.

              [7]

             And God made a firmament, and divided the waters that were under the firmament, from those that were above the firmament, and it was so.

              [8]

             And God called the firmament, Heaven; and the evening and morning were the second day.

              [9]
             </a>
             God also said: Let the waters that are under the heaven, be gathered together into one place: and let the dry land appear. And it was so done.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=1&amp;l=10-#x">
              [10]

             And God called the dry land, Earth; and the gathering together of the waters, he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.

             : By this name is here understood the whole space between the earth, and the highest stars. The lower part of which divideth the waters that are upon the earth, from those that are above in the clouds.

             And he said: Let the earth bring forth the green herb, and such as may seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its kind, which may have seed in itself upon the earth. And it was so done.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=1&amp;l=12-#x">
              [12]

             And the earth brought forth the green herb, and such as yieldeth seed according to its kind, and the tree that beareth fruit, having seed each one according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=1&amp;l=13-#x">

             And the evening and the morning were the third day.

             And God said: Let there be lights made in the firmament of heaven, to divide the day and the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=1&amp;l=15-#x">

             To shine in the firmament of heaven, and to give light upon the earth. And it was so done.

             And God made
             <u>
              two great lights
             </u>
             : a greater light to rule the day; and a lesser light to rule the night: and the stars.

             And he set them in the firmament of heaven to shine upon the earth.

              [18]
             </a>
             And to rule the day and the night, and to divide the light and the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=1&amp;l=19-#x">
              [19]

             And the evening and morning were the fourth day.

              [20]

             God also said: Let the waters bring forth the creeping creature having life, and the fowl that may fly over the earth under the firmament of heaven.

             : God created on the first day, light, which being moved from east to west, by its rising and setting, made morning and evening. But on the fourth day he ordered and distributed this light, and made the sun, moon, and stars. The moon, though much less than the stars, is here called a great light, from its giving a far greater light to the earth than any of them.

             And God created the great whales, and every living and moving creature, which the waters brought forth, according to their kinds, and every winged fowl according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.

             : This image of God in man, is not in the body, but in the soul; which is a spiritual substance, endued with understanding and free will. God speaketh here in the plural number, to insinuate the plurality of persons in the Deity.

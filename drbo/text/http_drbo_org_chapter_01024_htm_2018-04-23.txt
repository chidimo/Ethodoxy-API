               So they sent her away, and her nurse, and Abraham's servant, and his company,

               So Rebecca and her maids, being set upon camels, followed the man: who with speed returned to his master.

               At the same time Isaac was walking along the way to the well which is called Of the living and the seeing: for he dwelt in the south country.

               And he was gone forth to meditate in the field, the day being now well spent: and when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw camels coming afar off.

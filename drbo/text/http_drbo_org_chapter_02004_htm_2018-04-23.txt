               Moses is empowered to confirm his mission with miracles: his brother Aaron is appointed to assist him.

               Moses answered and said: They will not believe me, nor hear my voice, but they will say: The Lord hath not appeared to thee.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=2&amp;ch=4&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]
               </a>
               Then he said to him: What is that thou holdest in thy hand? He answered: A rod.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=2&amp;ch=4&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               And the Lord said: Cast it down upon the ground. He cast it down, and it was turned into a serpent: so that Moses fled from it.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=2&amp;ch=4&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               And the Lord said: Put out thy hand and take it by the tail. He put forth his hand, and took hold of it, and it was turned into a rod.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=2&amp;ch=4&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               That they may believe, saith he, that the Lord God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to thee.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=2&amp;ch=4&amp;l=6-#x">
                [6]
               </a>
               And the Lord said again: Put thy hand into thy bosom. And when he had put it into his bosom, he brought it forth leprous as snow.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=2&amp;ch=4&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               And he said: Put back thy hand into thy bosom. He put it back, and brought it out again, and it was like the other flesh.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=2&amp;ch=4&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]
               </a>
               If they will not believe thee, saith he, nor hear the voice of the former sign, they will believe the word of the latter sign.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=2&amp;ch=4&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               But if they will not even believe these two signs, nor hear thy voice: take of the river water, and pour it out upon the dry land, and whatsoever thou drawest out of the river shall be turned into blood.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=2&amp;ch=4&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]

               Moses said: I beseech thee, Lord. I am not eloquent from yesterday and the day before: and since thou hast spoken to thy servant, I have more impediment and slowness of tongue.
              </p>

               Moses went his way, and returned to Jethro his father in law and said to him: I will go and return to my brethren into Egypt, that I may see if they be yet alive. And Jethro said to him: Go in peace.

               The law of the seventh and of the fiftieth year of jubilee.

                [1]
               </a>
               And the Lord spoke to Moses in mount Sinai, saying:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=25&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]
               </a>
               Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: When you shall have entered into the land which I will give you, observe the rest of the sabbath to the Lord.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=25&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               Six years thou shalt sow thy field and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and shalt gather the fruits thereof:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=25&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               But in the seventh year there shall be a sabbath to the land, of the resting of the Lord: thou shalt not sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=25&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               What the ground shall bring forth of itself, thou shalt not reap: neither shalt thou gather the grapes of the firstfruits as a vintage: for it is a year of rest to the land:
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=25&amp;l=6-#x">
                [6]
               </a>
               But they shall be unto you for meat, to thee and to thy manservant, to thy maidservant and thy hireling, and to the strangers that sojourn with thee:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=25&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               All things that grow shall be meat to thy beasts and to thy cattle.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=25&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]
               </a>
               Thou shalt also number to thee seven weeks of years, that is to say, seven times seven, which together make forty-nine years:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=25&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               And thou shalt sound the trumpet in the seventh month, the tenth day of the month, in the time of the expiation in all your land.

                [10]

               And thou shalt sanctify the fiftieth year, and shalt proclaim

                remission
               </u>
               to all the inhabitants of thy land: for it is the year of jubilee. Every man shall return to his possession, and every one shall go back to his former family:

                "Remission"
               </u>
               : That is, a general release and discharge from debts and bondage, and a reinstating of every man in his former possessions.

                [11]
               </a>
               Because it is the jubilee and the fiftieth year. You shall not sow, nor reap the things that grow in the field of their own accord, neither shall you gather the firstfruits of the vines,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=25&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]

               Because of the sanctification of the jubilee: but as they grow you shall presently eat them.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=25&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               In the year of the jubilee all shall return to their possessions.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=25&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               When thou shalt sell any thing to thy neighbour, or shalt buy of him; grieve not thy brother: but thou shalt buy of him according to the number of years from the jubilee.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=25&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               And he shall sell to thee according to the computation of the fruits.

               The more years remain after the jubilee, the more shall the price increase: and the less time is counted, so much the less shall the purchase cost. For he shall sell to thee the time of the fruits.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=25&amp;l=17-#x">

               Do not afflict your countrymen, but let every one fear his God: because I am the Lord your God.

               I will give you my blessing the sixth year, and it shall yield the fruits of three years:

               And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=4&amp;ch=31&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]

                [3]

               And Moses forthwith said: Arm of you men to fight, who may take the revenge of the Lord on the Madianites.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=4&amp;ch=31&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]

               Let a thousand men be chosen out of every tribe of Israel to be sent to the war.

                [5]

               And they gave a thousand of every tribe, that is to say, twelve thousand men well appointed for battle.

               And Moses sent them with Phinees the son of Eleazar the priest, and he delivered to him the holy vessels, and the trumpets to sound.

               And their kings Evi, and Recem, and Sur, and Hur, and Rebe, five princes of the nation: Balaam also the son of Beer they killed with the sword.

                [9]

               And they took their women, and their children captives, and all their cattle, and all their goods: and all their possessions they plundered:

                [10]

               And they carried away the booty, and all that they had taken both of men and of beasts.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=4&amp;ch=31&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               And they brought them to Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and to all the multitude of the children of Israel. But the rest of the things for use they carried to the camp on the plains of Moab, beside the Jordan over against Jericho.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=4&amp;ch=31&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the princes of the synagogue went forth to meet them without the camp.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=4&amp;ch=31&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]

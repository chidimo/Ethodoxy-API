               And now, O Israel, hear the commandments and judgments which I teach thee: that doing them, thou mayst live, and entering in mayst possess the land which the Lord the God of your fathers will give you.

               You shall not add to the word that I speak to you, neither shall you take away from it: keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you.

               Your eyes have seen all that the Lord hath done against Beelphegor, how he hath destroyed all his worshippers from among you.

                [5]

               You know that I have taught you statutes and justices, as the Lord my God hath commanded me: so shall you do them in the land which you shall possess:

               And you shall observe, and fulfill them in practice. For this is your wisdom, and understanding in the sight of nations, that hearing all these precepts, they may say: Behold a wise and understanding people, a great nation.

               Keep thyself therefore, and thy soul carefully. Forget not the words that thy eyes have seen, and let them not go out of thy heart all the days of thy life. Thou shalt teach them to thy sons and to thy grandsons,

               From the day in which thou didst stand before the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the Lord spoke to me, saying: Call together the people unto me, that they may hear my words, and may learn to fear me all the time that they live on the earth, and may teach their children.
              </p>
              <p>

               And you came to the foot of the mount, which burned even unto heaven: and there was darkness, and a cloud and obscurity in it.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=5&amp;ch=4&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               And the Lord spoke to you from the midst of the fire. You heard the voice of his words, but you saw not any form at all.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=5&amp;ch=4&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               And he shewed you his covenant, which he commanded you to do, and the ten words that he wrote in two tables of stone.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=5&amp;ch=4&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               And he commanded me at that time that I should teach you the ceremonies and judgments which you shall do in the land, that you shall possess.

               Keep therefore your souls carefully. You saw not any similitude in the day that the Lord God spoke to you in Horeb from the midst of the fire:

               Lest perhaps being deceived you might make you a graven similitude, or image of male or female,

               Lest perhaps lifting up thy eyes to heaven, thou see the sun and the moon, and all the stars of heaven, and being deceived by error thou adore and serve them, which the Lord thy God created for the service of all the nations, that are under heaven.

               But the Lord hath taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace of Egypt, to make you his people of inheritance, as it is this present day.

               And the Lord was angry with me for your words, and he swore that I should not pass over the Jordan, nor enter into the excellent land, which he will give you.

               I call this day heaven and earth to witness, that you shall quickly perish out of the land, which, when you have passed over the Jordan, you shall possess. You shall not dwell therein long, but the Lord will destroy you,

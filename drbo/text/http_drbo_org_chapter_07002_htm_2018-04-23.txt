               And when the Lord raised them up judges, in their days he was moved to mercy, and heard the groanings of the afflicted, and delivered them from the slaughter of the oppressors.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=2&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               But after the judge was dead, they returned, and did much worse things than their fathers had done, following strange gods, serving them and adoring them. They left not their own inventions, and the stubborn way, by which they were accustomed to walk.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=2&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]
               </a>
               And the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he said: Behold this nation hath made void my covenant, which I had made with their fathers, and hath despised to hearken to my voice:
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=2&amp;l=21-#x">
                [21]
               </a>
               I also will not destroy the nations which Josue left, when he died:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=2&amp;l=22-#x">
                [22]
               </a>
               That through them I may try Israel, whether they will keep the way of the Lord, and walk in it, as their fathers kept it, or not.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=2&amp;l=23-#x">
                [23]
               </a>
               The Lord therefore left all these nations, and would not quickly destroy them, neither did he deliver them into the hands of Josue.
              </p>

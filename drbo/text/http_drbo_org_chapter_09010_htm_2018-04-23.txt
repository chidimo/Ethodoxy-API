Now there were in those days colleges, or schools for training up these prophets; and it seems there was one of these schools at this hill of God; and another at Najoth in Ramatha.

               And they came to the foresaid hill, and behold a company of prophets met him: and the spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he prophesied in the midst of them.

               And after this they consulted the Lord whether he would come thither. And the Lord answered: Behold he is hidden at home.

               Saul also departed to his own house in Gabaa: and there went with him a part of the army, whose hearts God had touched.

               And the sons of the prophets at Jericho, who were over against him, seeing it said: The spirit of Elias hath rested upon Eliseus. And coming to meet him,
               <u>
                they worshipped him

               And they said to him: Behold, there are with thy servants fifty strong men, that can go, and seek thy master, lest perhaps the spirit of the Lord hath taken him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley. And he said: Do not send.

               But they pressed him, till he consented, and said: Send. And they sent fifty men: and they sought three days but found him not.

               And they came back to him: for he abode at Jericho, and he said to them: Did I not say to you: Do not send?

               And the men of the city said to Eliseus: Behold the situation of this city is very good, as thou, my lord, seest: but the waters are very bad, and the ground barren.

               And he said: Bring me a new vessel, and put salt into it. And when they had brought it,
              </p>
              <p>

               He went out to the spring of the waters, and cast the salt into it, and said: Thus saith the Lord: I have healed these waters, and there shall be no more in them death or barrenness.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=12&amp;ch=2&amp;l=22-#x">

               And the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of Eliseus, which he spoke.

               And he went up from thence to Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, little boys came out of the city and mocked him, saying: Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.

               And looking back, he saw them, and
               <u>
                cursed them
               </u>
               in the name of the Lord: and there came forth two bears out of the forest, and tore of them two and forty boys.

               And from thence he went to mount Carmel, and from thence he returned to Samaria.

               : This curse, which was followed by so visible a judgment of God, was not the effect of passion, or of a desire of revenging himself; but of zeal for religion, which was insulted by these boys, in the person of the prophet; and of a divine inspiration: God punishing in this manner the inhabitants of Bethel, (the chief seat of the calf worship,) who had trained up their children in a prejudice against the true religion and its ministers.

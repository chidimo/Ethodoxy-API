               Ezechias is assured of God's help by Isaias the prophet. The king of the Assyrians still threateneth and blasphemeth. Ezechias prayeth, and God promiseth to protect Jerusalem. An angel destroyeth the army of the Assyrians, their king returneth to Nineve, and is slain by his two sons.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=12&amp;ch=19&amp;l=1-#x">
                [1]
               </a>
               And when king Ezechias heard these words, he rent his garments, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the Lord.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=12&amp;ch=19&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]
               </a>
               And he sent Eliacim, who was over the house, and Sobna the scribe, and the ancients of the priests covered with sackcloths, to Isaias the prophet the son of Amos,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=12&amp;ch=19&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               And they said to him: Thus saith Ezechias: This day is a day of tribulation, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: the children are come to the birth, and the woman in travail hath not strength.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=12&amp;ch=19&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               It may be the Lord thy God will hear all the words of Rabsaces, whom the king of the Assyrians his master hath sent to reproach the living God, and to reprove with words, which the Lord thy God hath heard: and do thou offer prayer for the remnants that are found.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=12&amp;ch=19&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               So the servants of king Ezechias came to Isaias.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=12&amp;ch=19&amp;l=6-#x">
                [6]
               </a>
               And Isaias said to them: Thus shall you say to your master: Thus saith the Lord: Be not afraid for the words which thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of the Assyrians have blasphemed me.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=12&amp;ch=19&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               Behold I will send a spirit upon him, and he shall hear a message, and shall return into his own country, and I will make him fall by the sword in his own country.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=12&amp;ch=19&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]
               </a>
               And Rabsaces returned, and found the king of the Assyrians besieging Lobna: for he had heard that he was departed from Lachis.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=12&amp;ch=19&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               And when he heard of Theraca king of Ethiopia: Behold, he is come out to fight with thee: and was going against him, he sent messengers to Ezechias, saying:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=12&amp;ch=19&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]
               </a>
               Thus shall you say to Ezechias king of Juda: Let not thy God deceive thee, in whom thou trustest: and do not say: Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hands of the king of the Assyrians.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=12&amp;ch=19&amp;l=11-#x">
                [11]
               </a>
               Behold thou hast heard what the kings of the Assyrians have done to all countries, how they have laid them waste: and canst thou alone be delivered?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=12&amp;ch=19&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               Have the gods of the nations delivered any of them, whom my fathers have destroyed, to wit, Gozan, and Haran, and Reseph, and the children of Eden that were in Thelassar?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=12&amp;ch=19&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               Where is the king of Emath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Ana and of Ava?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=12&amp;ch=19&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               And when Ezechias had received the letter of the hand of the messengers, and had read it, he went up to the house of the Lord, and spread it before the Lord,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=12&amp;ch=19&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               And he prayed in his sight, saying: O Lord God of Israel, who sitteth upon the cherubims, thou alone art the God of all the kings of the earth: thou madest heaven and earth:
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=12&amp;ch=19&amp;l=16-#x">
                [16]
               </a>
               Incline thy ear, and hear: open, O Lord, thy eyes, and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who hath sent to upbraid unto us the living God.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=12&amp;ch=19&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               Of a truth, O Lord, the kings of the Assyrians have destroyed nations, and the lands of them all.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=12&amp;ch=19&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               And they have cast their gods into the fire: for they were not gods, but the works of men's hands of wood and stone, and they destroyed them.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=12&amp;ch=19&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               Now therefore, O Lord our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know, that thou art the Lord the only God.

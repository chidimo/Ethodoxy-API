               And the seed of the children of Israel separated themselves from every stranger: and they stood, and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.

                [22]
               </a>
               And thou gavest them kingdoms, and nations, and didst divide lots for them: and they possessed the land of Sehon, and the land of the king of Hesebon, and the land of Og king of Basan.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=16&amp;ch=9&amp;l=23-#x">
                [23]
               </a>
               And thou didst multiply their children as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them to the land concerning which thou hadst said to their fathers, that they should go in and possess it.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=16&amp;ch=9&amp;l=24-#x">
                [24]
               </a>
               And the children came and possessed the land, and thou didst humble before them the inhabitants of the land, the Chanaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as it pleased them.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=16&amp;ch=9&amp;l=25-#x">
                [25]
               </a>
               And they took strong cities and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all goods: cisterns made by others, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: and they ate, and were filled, and became fat, and abounded with delight in thy great goodness.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=16&amp;ch=9&amp;l=26-#x">
                [26]
               </a>
               But they provoked thee to wrath, and departed from thee, and threw thy law behind their backs: and they killed thy prophets, who admonished them earnestly to return to thee: and they were guilty of great blasphemies.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=16&amp;ch=9&amp;l=27-#x">
                [27]
               </a>
               And thou gavest them into the hands of their enemies, and they afflicted them. And in the time of their tribulation they cried to thee, and thou heardest from heaven, and according to the multitude of thy tender mercies thou gavest them saviours, to save them from the hands of their enemies.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=16&amp;ch=9&amp;l=28-#x">
                [28]
               </a>
               But after they had rest, they returned to do evil in thy sight: and thou leftest them in the hand of their enemies, and they had dominion over them. Then they returned, and cried to thee: and thou heardest from heaven, and deliveredst them many times in thy mercies.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=16&amp;ch=9&amp;l=29-#x">
                [29]
               </a>
               And thou didst admonish them to return to thy law. But they dealt proudly, and hearkened not to thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them: and they withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=16&amp;ch=9&amp;l=30-#x">
                [30]
               </a>
               And thou didst forbear with them for many years, and didst testify against them by thy spirit by the hand of thy prophets: and they heard not, and thou didst deliver them into the hand of the people of the lands.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=16&amp;ch=9&amp;l=31-#x">
                [31]
               </a>
               Yet in thy very many mercies thou didst not utterly consume them, nor forsake them: because thou art a merciful and gracious God.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=16&amp;ch=9&amp;l=32-#x">
                [32]
               </a>
               Now therefore our God, great, strong and terrible, who keepest covenant and mercy, turn not away from thy face all the labour which hath come upon us, upon our kings, and our princes, and our priests, and our prophets, and our fathers, and all the people from the days of the king of Assur, until this day.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=16&amp;ch=9&amp;l=33-#x">
                [33]
               </a>
               And thou art just in all things that have come upon us: because thou hast done truth, but we have done wickedly.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=16&amp;ch=9&amp;l=34-#x">
                [34]
               </a>
               Our kings, our princes, our priests, and our fathers have not kept thy law, and have not minded thy commandments, and thy testimonies which thou hast testified among them.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=16&amp;ch=9&amp;l=35-#x">
                [35]
               </a>
               And they have not served thee in their kingdoms, and in thy manifold goodness, which thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land, which thou deliveredst before them, nor did they return from their most wicked devices.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=16&amp;ch=9&amp;l=36-#x">
                [36]
               </a>
               Behold we ourselves this day are bondmen: and the land, which thou gavest our fathers, to eat the bread thereof, and the good things thereof, and we ourselves are servants in it.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=16&amp;ch=9&amp;l=37-#x">
                [37]
               </a>
               And the fruits thereof grow up for the kings, whom thou hast set over us for our sins, and they have dominion over our bodies, and over our beasts, according to their will, and we are in great tribulation.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=16&amp;ch=9&amp;l=38-#x">
                [38]
               </a>
               And because of all this we ourselves make a covenant, and write it, and our princes, our Levites, and our priests sign it.

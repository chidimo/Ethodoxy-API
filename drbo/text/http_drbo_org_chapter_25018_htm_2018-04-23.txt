                [19]
               </a>
               For the visions that troubled them foreshewed these things, lest they should perish and not know why they suffered these evils.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=25&amp;ch=18&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]
               </a>
               But the just also were afterwards touched by an assault of death, and there was a disturbance of the multitude in the wilderness: but thy wrath did not long continue.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=25&amp;ch=18&amp;l=21-#x">
                [21]
               </a>
               For a blameless man made haste to pray for the people, bringing forth the shield of his ministry, prayer, and by incense making supplication, withstood the wrath, and put an end to the calamity, shewing that he was thy servant.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=25&amp;ch=18&amp;l=22-#x">
                [22]
               </a>
               And he overcame the disturbance, not by strength of body nor with force of arms, but with a word he subdued him that punished them, alleging the oaths and covenant made with the fathers.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=25&amp;ch=18&amp;l=23-#x">
                [23]
               </a>
               For when they were now fallen down dead by heaps one upon another, he stood between and stayed the assault, and cut off the way to the living.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=25&amp;ch=18&amp;l=24-#x">
                [24]
               </a>
               For in the priestly robe which he wore, was the whole world: and in the four rows of the stones the glory of the fathers was graven, and thy majesty was written upon the diadem of his head.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=25&amp;ch=18&amp;l=25-#x">
                [25]
               </a>
               And to these the destroyer gave place, and was afraid of them: for the proof only of wrath was enough.

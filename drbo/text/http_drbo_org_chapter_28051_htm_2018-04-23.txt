               </a>
               And I will make her princes drunk. and her wise men, and her captains, and her rulers, and her valiant men: and they shall sleep an everlasting sleep, and shall awake no more, saith the king whose name is Lord of hosts.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=28&amp;ch=51&amp;l=58-#x">
                [58]
               </a>
               Thus saith the Lord of hosts: That broad wall of Babylon shall be utterly broken down, and her high gates shall be burnt with fire, and the labours of the people shall come to nothing, and of the nations shall go to the fire, and shall perish.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=28&amp;ch=51&amp;l=59-#x">
                [59]
               </a>
               The word that Jeremias the prophet commanded Saraias the son of Nerias, the son of Maasias, when he went with king Sedecias to Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign: now Saraias was chief over the prophecy.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=28&amp;ch=51&amp;l=60-#x">
                [60]
               </a>
               And Jeremias wrote in one book all the evil that was to come upon Babylon: all these words that are written against Babylon.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=28&amp;ch=51&amp;l=61-#x">
                [61]
               </a>
               And Jeremias said to Saraias: When thou shalt come into Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=28&amp;ch=51&amp;l=62-#x">
                [62]
               </a>
               Thou shalt say: O Lord, thou hast spoken against this place to destroy it: so that there should be neither man nor beast to dwell therein, and that it should be desolate for ever.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=28&amp;ch=51&amp;l=63-#x">
                [63]
               </a>
               And when thou shalt have made an end of reading this book, thou shalt tie a stone to it, and shalt throw it into the midst of the Euphrates:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=28&amp;ch=51&amp;l=64-#x">
                [64]
               </a>
               And thou shalt say: Thus shall Babylon sink, and she shall not rise up from the affliction that I will bring upon her, and she shall be utterly destroyed. Thus far are the words of Jeremias.

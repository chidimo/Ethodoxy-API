               The prophet's lamentation for the king of Egypt.

               And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=31&amp;ch=32&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]

               Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharao the king of Egypt, and say to him: Thou art like the lion of the nations, and the dragon that is in the sea: and thou didst push with the horn in thy rivers, and didst trouble the waters with thy feet, and didst trample upon their streams.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=31&amp;ch=32&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               Therefore, thus saith the Lord God: I will spread out my net over thee with the multitude of many people, and I will draw thee up in my net.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=31&amp;ch=32&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               And I will throw thee out on the land, I will cast thee away into the open field: and I will cause all the fowls of the air to dwell upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of all the earth with thee.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=31&amp;ch=32&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and will fill thy hills with thy corruption,

               And I will cover the heavens, when thou shalt be put out, and I will make the stars thereof dark: I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.

               I will make all the lights of heaven to mourn over thee: and I will cause darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord God, when thy wounded shall fall in the midst of the land, saith the Lord God.

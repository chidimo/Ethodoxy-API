                shepherds

               My sheep have wandered in every mountain, and in every high hill: and my flocks were scattered upon the face of the earth, and there was none that sought them, there was none, I say, that sought them.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=31&amp;ch=34&amp;l=7-#x">

               As I live, saith the Lord God, forasmuch as my flocks have been made a spoil, and my sheep are become a prey to all the beasts of the field, because there was no shepherd: for my shepherds did not seek after my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flocks:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=31&amp;ch=34&amp;l=9-#x">

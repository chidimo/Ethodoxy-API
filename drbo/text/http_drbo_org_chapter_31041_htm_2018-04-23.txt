                "The temple"
               </u>
               : This plan of a temple, which was here shewn to the prophet in a vision, partly had relation to the material temple, which was to be rebuilt: and partly, in a mystical sense, to the spiritual temple of God, the church of Christ.

               And the side chambers

                one by another
               </u>
               , were twice thirty-three: and they bore outwards, that they might enter in through the wall of the house in the sides round about, to hold in, and not to touch the wall of the temple.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=31&amp;ch=41&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               And there was a broad passage round about, going up by winding stairs, and it led into the upper loft of the temple all round: therefore was the temple broader in the higher parts: and so from the lower parts they went to the higher by the midst.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=31&amp;ch=41&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]
               </a>
               And I saw in the house the height round about, the foundations of the side chambers which were the measure of a reed the space of six cubits:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=31&amp;ch=41&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               And the thickness of the wall for the side chamber without, which was five cubits:
               <u>
                and the inner house was within the side chambers of the house

                [10]
               </a>
               And between the chambers was the breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.

               </u>
               : Because these side chambers were in the very walls of the temple all round. Or, it may also be rendered (more agreeably to the Hebrew) so as to signify that the thickness of the wall for the side chamber within, was the same as that of the wall without; that is, equally five cubits.

               And the door of the side chambers was turned towards the place of prayer: one door was toward the north, and another door was toward the south: and the breadth of the place for prayer, was five cubits round about.

               And the breadth before the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the east, a hundred cubits.

               Daniel's vision of the ram and the he goat interpreted by the angel Gabriel.

               In the third year of the reign of king Baltasar, a vision appeared to me. I Daniel, after what I had seen in the beginning,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=32&amp;ch=8&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]
               </a>
               Saw in my vision when I was in the castle of Susa, which is in the province of Elam: and I saw in the vision that I was over the gate of Ulai.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=32&amp;ch=8&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               And I lifted up my eyes, and saw: and behold
               <u>
                a ram
               </u>
               stood before the water, having two high horns, and one higher than the other, and growing up.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=32&amp;ch=8&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               Afterward I saw the ram pushing with his horns against the west, and against the north, and against the south: and no beasts could withstand him, nor be delivered out of his hand: and he did according to his own will, and became great.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=32&amp;ch=8&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]

               And I understood: and behold

                a he goat
               </u>
               came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and
               <u>
                he touched not the ground

               , and the he goat had
               <u>
                a notable horn
               </u>
               between his eyes.

               And it came to pass when I Daniel saw the vision, and sought the meaning, that behold there stood before me as it were the appearance of a man.

               </u>
               : That is, six years and almost four months: which was the whole time from the beginning of the persecution of Antiochus till his death.

               And I heard the voice of a man between Ulai: and he called, and said: Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=32&amp;ch=8&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               And he came and stood near where I stood: and when he was come, I fell on my face trembling, and he said to me: Understand, O son of man, for in the time of the end the vision shall be fulfilled.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=32&amp;ch=8&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               And when he spoke to me I fell flat on the ground: and he touched me, and set me upright,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=32&amp;ch=8&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               And he said to me: I will shew thee what things are to come to pass in the end of the malediction: for the time hath its end.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=32&amp;ch=8&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]
               </a>
               The ram, which thou sawest with horns, is the king of the Medes and Persians.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=32&amp;ch=8&amp;l=21-#x">

               </a>
               And the he goat, is the king of the Greeks, and the great horn that was between his eyes, the same is the first king.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=32&amp;ch=8&amp;l=22-#x">

               But whereas when that was broken, there arose up four for it: four kings shall rise up of his nation, but not with his strength.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=32&amp;ch=8&amp;l=23-#x">
                [23]

               And after their reign, when iniquities shall be grown up, there shall arise a king of a shameless face, and understanding dark sentences.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=32&amp;ch=8&amp;l=24-#x">
                [24]
               </a>
               And his power shall be strengthened, but not by his own force: and he shall lay all things waste, and shall prosper, and do more than can be believed. And he shall destroy the mighty, and the people of the saints,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=32&amp;ch=8&amp;l=25-#x">
                [25]
               </a>
               According to his will, and craft shall be successful in his hand: and his heart shall be puffed up, and in the abundance of all things he shall kill many: and he shall rise up against the prince of princes, and shall be broken without hand.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=32&amp;ch=8&amp;l=26-#x">
                [26]
               </a>
               And the vision of the evening and the morning, which was told, is true: thou therefore seal up the vision, because it shall come to pass after many days.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=32&amp;ch=8&amp;l=27-#x">
                [27]
               </a>
               And I Daniel languished, and was sick for some days: and when I was risen up, I did the king's business, and I was astonished at the vision, and there was none that could interpret it.

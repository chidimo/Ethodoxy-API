               </a>
               And you shall eat in plenty, and shall be filled: and you shall praise the name of the Lord your God, who hath done wonders with you, and my people shall not be confounded for ever.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=34&amp;ch=2&amp;l=27-#x">
                [27]
               </a>
               And you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel: and I am the Lord your God, and there is none besides: and my people shall not be confounded for ever.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=34&amp;ch=2&amp;l=28-#x">
                [28]
               </a>
               And it shall come to pass after this, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy: your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=34&amp;ch=2&amp;l=29-#x">
                [29]
               </a>
               Moreover upon my servants and handmaids in those days I will pour forth my spirit.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=34&amp;ch=2&amp;l=30-#x">
                [30]
               </a>
               And I will shew wonders in heaven; and in earth, blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=34&amp;ch=2&amp;l=31-#x">
                [31]
               </a>
               The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood: before the great and dreadful day of the Lord doth come.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=34&amp;ch=2&amp;l=32-#x">
                [32]
               </a>
               And it shall come to pass, that every one that shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved: for in mount Sion, and in Jerusalem shall be salvation, as the Lord hath said, and in the residue whom the Lord shall call.

             Therefore whereas we purpose to keep the purification of the temple on the five and twentieth day of the month of Casleu, we thought it necessary to signify it to you: that you also may keep the day of Scenopegia, and the day of the fire, that was given when Nehemias offered sacrifice, after the temple and the altar was built.

              Persia

             , the priests that then were worshippers of God took privately the fire from the altar, and hid it in a valley where there was a deep pit without water, and there they kept it safe, so that the place was unknown to all men.

              [20]
             </a>
             But when many years had passed, and it pleased God that Nehemias should be sent by the king of Persia, he sent some of the posterity of those priests that had hid it, to seek for the fire: and as they told us, they found no fire, but thick water.

             Then he bade them draw it up, and bring it to him: and the priest Nehemias commanded the sacrifices that were laid on, to be sprinkled with the same water, both the wood, and the things that were laid upon it.

             And when this was done, and the time came that the sun shone out, which before was in a cloud, there was a great fire kindled, so that all wondered.

             And all the priests made prayer, while the sacrifice was consuming, Jonathan beginning, and the rest answering.

             And the prayer of Nehemias was after this manner: O Lord God, Creator of all things, dreadful and strong, just and merciful, who alone art the good king,
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=46&amp;ch=1&amp;l=25-#x">

             Receive the sacrifice for all thy people Israel, and preserve thy own portion, and sanctify it.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=46&amp;ch=1&amp;l=27-#x">
              [27]
             </a>
             Gather together our scattered people, deliver them that are slaves to the Gentiles, and look upon them that are despised and abhorred: that the Gentiles may know that thou art our God.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=46&amp;ch=1&amp;l=28-#x">
              [28]
             </a>
             Punish them that oppress us, and that treat us injuriously with pride.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=46&amp;ch=1&amp;l=29-#x">
              [29]
             </a>
             Establish thy people in thy holy place, as Moses hath spoken.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=46&amp;ch=1&amp;l=30-#x">
              [30]
             </a>
             And the priests sung hymns till the sacrifice was consumed.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=46&amp;ch=1&amp;l=31-#x">
              [31]
             </a>
             And when the sacrifice was consumed, Nehemias commanded the water that was left to be poured out upon the great stones.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=46&amp;ch=1&amp;l=32-#x">
              [32]
             </a>
             Which being done, there was kindled a flame from them: but it was consumed by the light that shined from the altar.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=46&amp;ch=1&amp;l=33-#x">
              [33]
             </a>
             And when this matter became public, it was told to the king of Persia, that in the place where the priests that were led away, had hid the fire, there appeared water, with which Nehemias and they that were with him had purified the sacrifices.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=46&amp;ch=1&amp;l=34-#x">
              [34]
             </a>
             And the king considering, and diligently examining the matter, made
             <u>
              a temple
             </u>
             for it, that he might prove what had happened.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=46&amp;ch=1&amp;l=35-#x">
              [35]
             </a>
             And when he had proved it, he gave the priests many goods, and divers presents, and he took and distributed them to them with his own hand.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
             [34]
             <u>
              "A temple"
             </u>
             : That is, an enclosure, or a wall round about the place where the fire was hid, to separate it from profane uses, to the end that it might be respected as a holy place.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=46&amp;ch=1&amp;l=36-#x">
              [36]
             </a>
             And Nehemias called this place Nephthar, which is interpreted purification. But many call it Nephi.

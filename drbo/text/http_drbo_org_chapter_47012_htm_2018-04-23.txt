               At that time Jesus went through the corn on the sabbath: and his disciples being hungry, began to pluck the ears, and to eat.

                [5]

               Or have ye not read in the law, that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple break the sabbath, and are without blame?

               For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath.

                [9]

               And when he had passed from thence, he came into their synagogues.

                [10]

               And behold there was a man who had a withered hand, and they asked him, saying: Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=12&amp;l=11-#x">

               But he said to them: What man shall there be among you, that hath one sheep: and if the same fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not take hold on it and lift it up?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=12&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               How much better is a man than a sheep? Therefore it is lawful to do a good deed on the sabbath days.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=12&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               Then he saith to the man: Stretch forth thy hand; and he stretched it forth, and it was restored to health even as the other.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=12&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               And the Pharisees going out made a consultation against him, how they might destroy him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=12&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]

               But Jesus knowing it, retired from thence: and many followed him, and he healed them all.
              </p>

                [16]
               </a>
               And he charged them that they should not make him known.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=12&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaias the prophet, saying:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=12&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul hath been well pleased. I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.

               : The sin here spoken of is that blasphemy, by which the Pharisees attributed the miracles of Christ, wrought by the Spirit of God, to Beelzebub the prince of devils. Now this kind of sin is usually accompanied with so much obstinacy, and such wilful opposing the Spirit of God, and the known truth, that men who are guilty of it, are seldom or never converted: and therefore are never forgiven, because they will not repent. Otherwise there is no sin, which God cannot or will not forgive to such as sincerely repent, and have recourse to the keys of the church.

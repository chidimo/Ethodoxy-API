               Christ teaches humility, to beware of scandal, and to flee the occasions of sin: to denounce to the church incorrigible sinners, and to look upon such as refuse to hear the church as heathens. He promises to his disciples the power of binding and loosing: and that he will be in the midst of their assemblies. No forgiveness for them that will not forgive.

               At that hour the disciples came to Jesus, saying: Who thinkest thou is the greater in the kingdom of heaven?

                [3]

               Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, he is the greater in the kingdom of heaven.

               one of these little ones that believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone should be hanged about his neck, and that he should be drowned in the depth of the sea.

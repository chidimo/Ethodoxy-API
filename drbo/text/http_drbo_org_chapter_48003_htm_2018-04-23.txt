               Christ heals the withered hand. He chooses the twelve. He confutes the blasphemy of the Pharisees.

               And he entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had a withered hand.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=3&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]

               And they watched him whether he would heal on the sabbath days; that they might accuse him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=3&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               And he said to the man who had the withered hand: Stand up in the midst.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=3&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               And he saith to them: Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy? But they held their peace.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=3&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               And looking round about on them with anger, being grieved for the blindness of their hearts, he saith to the man: Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth: and his hand was restored unto him.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=3&amp;l=6-#x">
                [6]
               </a>
               And the Pharisees going out, immediately made a consultation with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=3&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               But Jesus retired with his disciples to the sea; and a great multitude followed him from Galilee and Judea,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=3&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]

               And from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond the Jordan. And they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing the things which he did, came to him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=3&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               And he spoke to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=3&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]

               For he healed many, so that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had evils.

                [11]
               </a>
               And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him: and they cried, saying:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=3&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               Thou art the Son of God. And he strictly charged them that they should not make him known.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=3&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               And going up into a mountain, he called unto him whom he would himself: and they came to him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=3&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               And he made that twelve should be with him, and that he might send them to preach.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=3&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               And he gave them power to heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=3&amp;l=16-#x">
                [16]

               And to Simon he gave the name Peter:

                [17]
               </a>
               And James the son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he named them Boanerges, which is, The sons of thunder:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=3&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               And Andrew and Philip, and Bartholomew and Matthew, and Thomas and James of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Cananean:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=3&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               And Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=3&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]
               </a>
               And they come to a house, and the multitude cometh together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=3&amp;l=21-#x">
                [21]
               </a>
               And when his friends had heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him. For they said: He is become mad.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=3&amp;l=22-#x">
                [22]
               </a>
               And the scribes who were come down from Jerusalem, said: He hath Beelzebub, and by the prince of devils he casteth out devils.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=3&amp;l=23-#x">
                [23]
               </a>
               And after he had called them together, he said to them in parables: How can Satan cast out Satan?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=3&amp;l=24-#x">
                [24]

               And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=3&amp;l=25-#x">
                [25]

               And if Satan be risen up against himself, he is divided, and cannot stand, but hath an end.

               </a>
               Amen I say to you, that all sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and the blasphemies wherewith they shall blaspheme:

               But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, shall never have forgiveness, but shall be guilty of an everlasting sin.

               And his mother and his brethren came; and standing without, sent unto him, calling him.

               And answering them, he said: Who is my mother and my brethren?

                [34]
               </a>
               And looking round about on them who sat about him, he saith: Behold my mother and my brethren.

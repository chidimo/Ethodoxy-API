               Christ rebukes the Pharisees. He heals the daughter of the woman of Chanaan; and the man that was deaf and dumb.

               And when they come from the market, unless they be washed, they eat not: and many other things there are that have been delivered to them to observe, the washings of cups and of pots, and of brazen vessels, and of beds.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=7&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]

               There is nothing from without a man that entering into him, can defile him. But the things which come from a man, those are they that defile a man.

               And rising from thence he went into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon: and entering into a house, he would that no man should know it, and he could not be hid.

               For the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophenician born. And she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=7&amp;l=27-#x">
                [27]
               </a>
               Who said to her: Suffer first the children to be filled: for it is not good to take the bread of the children, and cast it to the dogs.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=7&amp;l=28-#x">
                [28]
               </a>
               But she answered and said to him: Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat under the table of the crumbs of the children.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=7&amp;l=29-#x">
                [29]
               </a>
               And he said to her: For this saying go thy way, the devil is gone out of thy daughter.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=7&amp;l=30-#x">
                [30]
               </a>
               And when she was come into her house, she found the girl lying upon the bed, and that the devil was gone out.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=7&amp;l=31-#x">
                [31]
               </a>
               And again going out of the coasts of Tyre, he came by Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=7&amp;l=32-#x">
                [32]
               </a>
               And they bring to him one deaf and dumb; and they besought him that he would lay his hand upon him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=7&amp;l=33-#x">
                [33]
               </a>
               And taking him from the multitude apart, he put his fingers into his ears, and spitting, he touched his tongue:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=7&amp;l=34-#x">
                [34]
               </a>
               And looking up to heaven, he groaned, and said to him: Ephpheta, which is, Be thou opened.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=7&amp;l=35-#x">
                [35]
               </a>
               And immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke right.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=7&amp;l=36-#x">
                [36]
               </a>
               And he charged them that they should tell no man. But the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal did they publish it.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=7&amp;l=37-#x">
                [37]
               </a>
               And so much the more did they wonder, saying: He hath done all things well; he hath made both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.

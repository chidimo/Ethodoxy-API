               was after two days; and the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might by some wile lay hold on him, and kill him.

               And when he was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper, and was at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of precious spikenard: and breaking the alabaster box, she poured it out upon his head.

               Now there were some that had indignation within themselves, and said: Why was this waste of the ointment made?

               For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and given to the poor. And they murmured against her.

               Who hearing it were glad; and they promised him they would give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.

               Now on the first day of the unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the pasch, the disciples say to him: Whither wilt thou that we go, and prepare for thee to eat the pasch?

               And he sendeth two of his disciples, and saith to them: Go ye into the city; and there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water, follow him;

               And whithersoever he shall go in, say to the master of the house, The master saith, Where is my refectory, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=14&amp;l=15-#x">

               And his disciples went their way, and came into the city; and they found as he had told them, and they prepared the pasch.

               And when they were at table and eating, Jesus saith: Amen I say to you, one of you that eateth with me shall betray me.

               But they began to be sorrowful, and to say to him one by one: Is it I?

               And the Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed. It were better for him, if that man had not been born.

               And whilst they were eating, Jesus took bread; and blessing, broke, and gave to them, and said: Take ye. This is my body.

               And having taken the chalice, giving thanks, he gave it to them. And they all drank of it.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=14&amp;l=24-#x">
                [24]

               And he said to them: This is my blood of the new testament, which shall be shed for many.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=14&amp;l=25-#x">

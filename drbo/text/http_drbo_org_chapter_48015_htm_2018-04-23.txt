               And straightway in the morning, the chief priests holding a consultation with the ancients and the scribes and the whole council, binding Jesus, led him away, and delivered him to Pilate.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]

               And Pilate asked him: Art thou the king of the Jews? But he answering, saith to him: Thou sayest it.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]

               And the chief priests accused him in many things.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               And Pilate again asked him, saying: Answerest thou nothing? behold in how many things they accuse thee.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               But Jesus still answered nothing; so that Pilate wondered.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=6-#x">
                [6]
               </a>
               Now on the festival day he was wont to release unto them one of the prisoners, whomsoever they demanded.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               And there was one called Barabbas, who was put in prison with some seditious men, who in the sedition had committed murder.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]
               </a>
               And when the multitude was come up, they began to desire that he would do, as he had ever done unto them.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               And Pilate answered them, and said: Will you that I release to you the king of the Jews?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]
               </a>
               For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up out of envy.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=11-#x">
                [11]
               </a>
               But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas to them.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               And Pilate again answering, saith to them: What will you then that I do to the king of the Jews?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               But they again cried out: Crucify him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               And Pilate saith to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more: Crucify him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               And so Pilate being willing to satisfy the people, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=16-#x">
                [16]
               </a>
               And the soldiers led him away into the court of the palace, and they called together the whole band:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               And they clothe him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               And they began to salute him: Hail, king of the Jews.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               And they struck his head with a reed: and they did spit on him. And bowing their knees, they adored him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]
               </a>
               And after they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own garments on him, and they led him out to crucify him.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=21-#x">
                [21]
               </a>
               And they forced one Simon a Cyrenian who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and of Rufus, to take up his cross.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=22-#x">
                [22]
               </a>
               And they bring him into the place called Golgotha, which being interpreted is, The place of Calvary.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=23-#x">
                [23]
               </a>
               And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh; but he took it not.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=24-#x">
                [24]
               </a>
               And crucifying him, they divided his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=25-#x">
                [25]
               </a>
               And it was
               <u>
                the third hour
               </u>
               , and they crucified him.
              </p>
              <p class="note">
               [25]
               <u>
                "The third hour"
               </u>
               : The ancient account divided the day into four parts, which were named from the hour from which they began; the first, third, sixth, and ninth hour. Our Lord was crucified a little before noon; before the third hour had quite expired; but when the sixth hour was near at hand.

               And the inscription of his cause was written over: THE KING OF THE JEWS.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=27-#x">
                [27]
               </a>
               And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=28-#x">
                [28]
               </a>
               And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith: And with the wicked he was reputed.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=29-#x">
                [29]
               </a>
               And they that passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God, and in three days buildest it up again;
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=30-#x">
                [30]
               </a>
               Save thyself, coming down from the cross.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=31-#x">
                [31]
               </a>
               In like manner also the chief priests mocking, said with the scribes one to another: He saved others; himself he cannot save.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=32-#x">
                [32]
               </a>
               Let Christ the king of Israel come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=33-#x">
                [33]
               </a>
               And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole earth until the ninth hour.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=34-#x">
                [34]
               </a>
               And at the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabacthani? Which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=35-#x">
                [35]
               </a>
               And some of the standers by hearing, said: Behold he calleth Elias.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=36-#x">
                [36]
               </a>
               And one running and filling a sponge with vinegar, and putting it upon a reed, gave him to drink, saying: Stay, let us see if Elias come to take him down.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=37-#x">
                [37]
               </a>
               And Jesus having cried out with a loud voice, gave up the ghost.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=38-#x">
                [38]
               </a>
               And the veil of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=39-#x">
                [39]
               </a>
               And the centurion who stood over against him, seeing that crying out in this manner he had given up the ghost, said: Indeed this man was the son of God.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=40-#x">
                [40]
               </a>
               And there were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joseph, and Salome:
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=41-#x">
                [41]
               </a>
               Who also when he was in Galilee followed him, and ministered to him, and many other women that came up with him to Jerusalem.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=42-#x">
                [42]
               </a>
               And when evening was now come, (because it was the Parasceve, that is, the day before the sabbath,)
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=43-#x">
                [43]
               </a>
               Joseph of Arimathea, a noble counsellor, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=44-#x">
                [44]
               </a>
               But Pilate wondered that he should be already dead. And sending for the centurion, he asked him if he were already dead.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=45-#x">
                [45]
               </a>
               And when he had understood it by the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=46-#x">
                [46]
               </a>
               And Joseph buying fine linen, and taking him down, wrapped him up in the fine linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewed out of a rock. And he rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=15&amp;l=47-#x">
                [47]
               </a>
               And Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of Joseph, beheld where he was laid.

             Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a narration of the things that have been accomplished among us;
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=2-#x">
              [2]

             According as they have delivered them unto us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word:
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=3-#x">
              [3]
             </a>
             It seemed good to me also, having diligently attained to all things from the beginning, to write to thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=4-#x">
              [4]
             </a>
             That thou mayest know the verity of those words in which thou hast been instructed.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=5-#x">
              [5]
             </a>
             There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zachary,
             <u>
              of the course of Abia
             </u>
             ; and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
             [5]
             <u>
              "Of the course of Abia"
             </u>
             : that is, of the rank of Abia, which word in the Greek is commonly put for the employment of one day: but here for the functions of a whole week. For, by the appointment of David, 1 Par. 24., the descendants from Aaron were divided into twenty-four families, of which the eighth was Abia, from whom descended this Zachary, who at this time was in the week of his priestly functions.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=6-#x">
              [6]
             </a>
             And they were both just before God, walking in all the commandments and justifications of the Lord without blame.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=7-#x">
              [7]
             </a>
             And they had no son, for that Elizabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in years.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=8-#x">
              [8]
             </a>
             And it came to pass, when he executed the priestly function in the order of his course before God,
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=9-#x">
              [9]
             </a>
             According to the custom of the priestly office, it was his lot to offer incense, going into the temple of the Lord.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=10-#x">
              [10]
             </a>
             And all the multitude of the people was praying without, at the hour of incense.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=11-#x">
              [11]
             </a>
             And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=12-#x">
              [12]
             </a>
             And Zachary seeing him, was troubled, and fear fell upon him.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=13-#x">
              [13]
             </a>
             But the angel said to him: Fear not, Zachary, for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John:
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=14-#x">
              [14]
             </a>
             And thou shalt have joy and gladness, and many shall rejoice in his nativity.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=15-#x">
              [15]
             </a>
             For he shall be great before the Lord; and shall drink no wine nor strong drink: and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=16-#x">
              [16]
             </a>
             And he shall convert many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=17-#x">
              [17]
             </a>
             And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias; that he may turn the hearts of the fathers unto the children, and the incredulous to the wisdom of the just, to prepare unto the Lord a perfect people.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=18-#x">
              [18]
             </a>
             And Zachary said to the angel: Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=19-#x">
              [19]
             </a>
             And the angel answering, said to him: I am Gabriel, who stand before God: and am sent to speak to thee, and to bring thee these good tidings.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=20-#x">
              [20]
             </a>
             And behold, thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be able to speak until the day wherein these things shall come to pass, because thou hast not believed my words, which shall be fulfilled in their time.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=21-#x">
              [21]
             </a>
             And the people were waiting for Zachary; and they wondered that he tarried so long in the temple.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=22-#x">
              [22]
             </a>
             And when he came out, he could not speak to them: and they understood that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he made signs to them, and remained dumb.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=23-#x">
              [23]
             </a>
             And it came to pass, after the days of his office were accomplished, he departed to his own house.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=24-#x">
              [24]
             </a>
             And after those days, Elizabeth his wife conceived, and hid herself five months, saying:
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=25-#x">
              [25]
             </a>
             Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he hath had regard to take away my reproach among men.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=26-#x">
              [26]
             </a>
             And in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God into a city of Galilee, called Nazareth,
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=1&amp;l=27-#x">
              [27]
             </a>
             To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.

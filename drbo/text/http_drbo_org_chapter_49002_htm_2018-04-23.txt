               And after eight days were accomplished, that the child should be circumcised, his name was called JESUS, which was called by the angel, before he was conceived in the womb.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=2&amp;l=22-#x">

               And after the days of her purification, according to the law of Moses, were accomplished, they carried him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=2&amp;l=23-#x">
                [23]

               As it is written in the law of the Lord: Every male opening the womb shall be called holy to the Lord:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=2&amp;l=24-#x">
                [24]

               And to offer a sacrifice, according as it is written in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=2&amp;l=25-#x">

               And behold there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon, and this man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel; and the Holy Ghost was in him.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=2&amp;l=26-#x">
                [26]
               </a>
               And he had received an answer from the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Christ of the Lord.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=2&amp;l=27-#x">
                [27]
               </a>
               And he came by the Spirit into the temple. And when his parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the law,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=2&amp;l=28-#x">
                [28]
               </a>
               He also took him into his arms, and blessed God, and said:

                [30]

               Because my eyes have seen thy salvation,

                [32]

               A light to the revelation of the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=2&amp;l=33-#x">
                [33]

               And his father and mother were wondering at those things which were spoken concerning him.

                [34]

               And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother: Behold this child is set
               <u>
                for the fall
               </u>

               And thy own soul a sword shall pierce, that, out of many hearts, thoughts may be revealed.

               : Christ came for the salvation of all men; but here Simeon prophesies what would come to pass, that many through their own wilful blindness and obstinacy would not believe in Christ, nor receive his doctrine, which therefore would be ruin to them: but to others a resurrection, by their believing in him, and obeying his commandments.
              </p>

               And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser; she was far advanced in years, and had lived with her husband seven years from her virginity.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=2&amp;l=37-#x">

               And she was a widow until fourscore and four years; who departed not from the temple, by fastings and prayers serving night and day.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=2&amp;l=38-#x">
                [38]
               </a>
               Now she, at the same hour, coming in, confessed to the Lord; and spoke of him to all that looked for the redemption of Israel.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=2&amp;l=39-#x">

               And after they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their city Nazareth.

               And the child grew, and waxed strong, full of wisdom; and the grace of God was in him.

               And his parents went every year to Jerusalem, at the solemn day of the pasch,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=2&amp;l=42-#x">
                [42]
               </a>
               And when he was twelve years old, they going up into Jerusalem, according to the custom of the feast,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=2&amp;l=43-#x">
                [43]
               </a>
               And having fulfilled the days, when they returned, the child Jesus remained in Jerusalem; and his parents knew it not.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=2&amp;l=44-#x">
                [44]
               </a>
               And thinking that he was in the company, they came a day's journey, and sought him among their kinsfolks and acquaintance.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=2&amp;l=45-#x">
                [45]
               </a>
               And not finding him, they returned into Jerusalem, seeking him.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=2&amp;l=46-#x">
                [46]
               </a>
               And it came to pass, that, after three days, they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, hearing them, and asking them questions.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=2&amp;l=47-#x">
                [47]
               </a>
               And all that heard him were astonished at his wisdom and his answers.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=2&amp;l=48-#x">
                [48]
               </a>
               And seeing him, they wondered. And his mother said to him: Son, why hast thou done so to us? behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=2&amp;l=49-#x">
                [49]
               </a>
               And he said to them: How is it that you sought me? did you not know, that I must be about my father's business?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=2&amp;l=50-#x">
                [50]
               </a>
               And they understood not the word that he spoke unto them.
              </p>
              <p>

                [51]
               </a>
               And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And his mother kept all these words in her heart.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=2&amp;l=52-#x">
                [52]

               And Jesus advanced in wisdom, and age, and grace with God and men.

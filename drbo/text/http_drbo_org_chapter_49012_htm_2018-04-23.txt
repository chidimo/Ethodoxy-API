               Christ warns us against hypocrisy, the fear of the world and covetousness. He admonishes all to watch.

               And when great multitudes stood about him, so that they trod one upon another, he began to say to his disciples: Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=12&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]

               For there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed: nor hidden, that shall not be known.

                [3]

               For whatsoever things you have spoken in darkness, shall be published in the light: and that which you have spoken in the ear in the chambers, shall be preached on the housetops.

                [4]

               And I say to you, my friends: Be not afraid of them who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.

                [5]

               But I will shew you whom you shall fear: fear ye him, who after he hath killed, hath power to cast into hell. Yea, I say to you, fear him.

               And he said to them: Take heed and beware of all covetousness; for a man's life doth not consist in the abundance of things which he possesseth.
              </p>
              <p>

               And he spoke a similitude to them, saying: The land of a certain rich man brought forth plenty of fruits.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=12&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               And he thought within himself, saying: What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=12&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               And he said: This will I do: I will pull down my barns, and will build greater; and into them will I gather all things that are grown to me, and my goods.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=12&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]

               And I will say to my soul: Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years take thy rest; eat, drink, make good cheer.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=12&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]

               But God said to him: Thou fool, this night do they require thy soul of thee: and whose shall those things be which thou hast provided?

               So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich towards God.

               Consider the ravens, for they sow not, neither do they reap, neither have they storehouse nor barn, and God feedeth them. How much are you more valuable than they?

               Consider the lilies, how they grow: they labour not, neither do they spin. But I say to you, not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these.

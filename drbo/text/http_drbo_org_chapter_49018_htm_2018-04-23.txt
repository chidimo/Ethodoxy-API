               And he spoke also a parable to them, that we ought always to pray, and not to faint,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]
               </a>
               Saying: There was a judge in a certain city, who feared not God, nor regarded man.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               And there was a certain widow in that city, and she came to him, saying:
               <u>
                Avenge
               </u>
               me of my adversary.

                [4]
               </a>
               And he would not for a long time. But afterwards he said within himself: Although I fear not God, nor regard man,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               Yet because this widow is troublesome to me, I will avenge her, lest continually coming she weary me.

                [6]

               And the Lord said: Hear what the unjust judge saith.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]

               And will not God revenge his elect who cry to him day and night: and will he have patience in their regard?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]

               I say to you, that he will quickly revenge them. But yet the Son of man, when he cometh, shall he find, think you, faith on earth?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               And to some who trusted in themselves as just, and despised others, he spoke also this parable:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]
               </a>
               Two men went up into the temple to pray: the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=11-#x">
                [11]
               </a>
               The Pharisee standing, prayed thus with himself: O God, I give thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, as also is this publican.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               I fast twice in a week: I give tithes of all that I possess.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               And the publican, standing afar off, would not so much as lift up his eyes towards heaven; but struck his breast, saying: O God, be merciful to me a sinner.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               I say to you, this man went down into his house justified rather than the other: because every one that exalteth himself, shall be humbled: and he that humbleth himself, shall be exalted.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               And they brought unto him also infants, that he might touch them. Which when the disciples saw, they rebuked them.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=16-#x">
                [16]
               </a>
               But Jesus, calling them together, said: Suffer children to come to me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               Amen, I say to you: Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a child, shall not enter into it.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               And a certain ruler asked him, saying: Good master, what shall I do to possess everlasting life?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               And Jesus said to him: Why dost thou call me good? None is good but God alone.

                [21]
               </a>
               Who said: All these things have I kept from my youth.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=22-#x">
                [22]
               </a>
               Which when Jesus had heard, he said to him: Yet one thing is wanting to thee: sell all whatever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=23-#x">
                [23]
               </a>
               He having heard these things, became sorrowful; for he was very rich.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=24-#x">
                [24]
               </a>
               And Jesus seeing him become sorrowful, said: How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=25-#x">
                [25]
               </a>
               For it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=26-#x">
                [26]
               </a>
               And they that heard it, said: Who then can be saved?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=27-#x">
                [27]
               </a>
               He said to them: The things that are impossible with men, are possible with God.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=28-#x">
                [28]
               </a>
               Then Peter said: Behold, we have left all things, and have followed thee.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=29-#x">
                [29]
               </a>
               Who said to them: Amen, I say to you, there is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=30-#x">
                [30]
               </a>
               Who shall not receive much more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=31-#x">
                [31]
               </a>
               Then Jesus took unto him the twelve, and said to them: Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things shall be accomplished which were written by the prophets concerning the Son of man.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=32-#x">
                [32]
               </a>
               For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and scourged, and spit upon:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=33-#x">
                [33]
               </a>
               And after they have scourged him, they will put him to death; and the third day he shall rise again.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=34-#x">
                [34]
               </a>
               And they understood none of these things, and this word was hid from them, and they understood not the things that were said.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=35-#x">
                [35]
               </a>
               Now it came to pass, when he drew nigh to Jericho, that a certain blind man sat by the way side, begging.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=36-#x">
                [36]
               </a>
               And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this meant.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=37-#x">
                [37]
               </a>
               And they told him, that Jesus of Nazareth was passing by.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=38-#x">
                [38]
               </a>
               And he cried out, saying: Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=39-#x">
                [39]
               </a>
               And they that went before, rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried out much more: Son of David, have mercy on me.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=40-#x">
                [40]
               </a>
               And Jesus standing, commanded him to be brought unto him. And when he was come near, he asked him,
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=41-#x">
                [41]
               </a>
               Saying: What wilt thou that I do to thee? But he said: Lord, that I may see.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=42-#x">
                [42]
               </a>
               And Jesus said to him: Receive thy sight: thy faith hath made thee whole.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=18&amp;l=43-#x">
                [43]
               </a>
               And immediately he saw, and followed him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.

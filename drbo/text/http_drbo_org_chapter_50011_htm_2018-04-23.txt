               Christ raises Lazarus to life. The rulers resolve to put him to death.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=1-#x">
                [1]
               </a>
               Now there was a certain man sick, named Lazarus, of Bethania, of the town of Mary and Martha her sister.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]
               </a>
               (And Mary was she that anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair: whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               His sisters therefore sent to him, saying: Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               And Jesus hearing it, said to them: This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God: that the Son of God may be glorified by it.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister Mary, and Lazarus.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=6-#x">
                [6]
               </a>
               When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he still remained in the same place two days.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               Then after that, he said to his disciples: Let us go into Judea again.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]
               </a>
               The disciples say to him: Rabbi, the Jews but now sought to stone thee: and goest thou thither again?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               Jesus answered: Are there not twelve hours of the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]
               </a>
               But if he walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=11-#x">
                [11]
               </a>
               These things he said; and after that he said to them: Lazarus our friend sleepeth; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               His disciples therefore said: Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               But Jesus spoke of his death; and they thought that he spoke of the repose of sleep.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               Then therefore Jesus said to them plainly: Lazarus is dead.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               And I am glad, for your sakes, that I was not there, that you may believe: but let us go to him.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=16-#x">
                [16]
               </a>
               Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples: Let us also go, that we may die with him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               Jesus therefore came, and found that he had been four days already in the grave.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               (Now Bethania was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off.)
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               And many of the Jews were come to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]
               </a>
               Martha therefore, as soon as she heard that Jesus had come, went to meet him: but Mary sat at home.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=21-#x">
                [21]
               </a>
               Martha therefore said to Jesus: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=22-#x">
                [22]
               </a>
               But now also I know that whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=23-#x">
                [23]
               </a>
               Jesus saith to her: Thy brother shall rise again.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=24-#x">
                [24]
               </a>
               Martha saith to him: I know that he shall rise again, in the resurrection at the last day.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=25-#x">
                [25]
               </a>
               Jesus said to her: I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, although he be dead, shall live:
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=26-#x">
                [26]
               </a>
               And every one that liveth, and believeth in me, shall not die for ever. Believest thou this?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=27-#x">
                [27]
               </a>
               She saith to him: Yea, Lord, I have believed that thou art Christ the Son of the living God, who art come into this world.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=28-#x">
                [28]
               </a>
               And when she had said these things, she went, and called her sister Mary secretly, saying: The master is come, and calleth for thee.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=29-#x">
                [29]
               </a>
               She, as soon as she heard this, riseth quickly, and cometh to him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=30-#x">
                [30]
               </a>
               For Jesus was not yet come into the town: but he was still in that place where Martha had met him.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=31-#x">
                [31]
               </a>
               The Jews therefore, who were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw Mary that she rose up speedily and went out, followed her, saying: She goeth to the grave to weep there.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=32-#x">
                [32]
               </a>
               When Mary therefore was come where Jesus was, seeing him, she fell down at his feet, and saith to him: Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=33-#x">
                [33]
               </a>
               Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews that were come with her, weeping, groaned in the spirit, and troubled himself,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=34-#x">
                [34]
               </a>
               And said: Where have you laid him? They say to him: Lord, come and see.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=35-#x">
                [35]
               </a>
               And Jesus wept.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=36-#x">
                [36]
               </a>
               The Jews therefore said: Behold how he loved him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=37-#x">
                [37]
               </a>
               But some of them said: Could not he that opened the eyes of the man born blind, have caused that this man should not die?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=38-#x">
                [38]
               </a>
               Jesus therefore again groaning in himself, cometh to the sepulchre. Now it was a cave; and a stone was laid over it.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=39-#x">
                [39]
               </a>
               Jesus saith: Take away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith to him: Lord, by this time he stinketh, for he is now of four days.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=40-#x">
                [40]
               </a>
               Jesus saith to her: Did not I say to thee, that if thou believe, thou shalt see the glory of God?
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=41-#x">
                [41]
               </a>
               They took therefore the stone away. And Jesus lifting up his eyes said: Father, I give thee thanks that thou hast heard me.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=42-#x">
                [42]
               </a>
               And I knew that thou hearest me always; but because of the people who stand about have I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=43-#x">
                [43]
               </a>
               When he had said these things, he cried with a loud voice: Lazarus, come forth.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=44-#x">
                [44]
               </a>
               And presently he that had been dead came forth, bound feet and hands with winding bands; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus said to them: Loose him, and let him go.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=45-#x">
                [45]
               </a>
               Many therefore of the Jews, who were come to Mary and Martha, and had seen the things that Jesus did, believed in him.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=46-#x">
                [46]
               </a>
               But some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them the things that Jesus had done.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=47-#x">
                [47]
               </a>
               The chief priests therefore, and the Pharisees, gathered a council, and said: What do we, for this man doth many miracles?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=48-#x">
                [48]
               </a>
               If we let him alone so, all will believe in him; and the Romans will come, and take away our place and nation.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=49-#x">
                [49]
               </a>
               But one of them, named Caiphas, being the high priest that year, said to them: You know nothing.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=50-#x">
                [50]
               </a>
               Neither do you consider that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=51-#x">
                [51]
               </a>
               And this he spoke not of himself: but being the high priest of that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=52-#x">
                [52]
               </a>
               And not only for the nation, but to gather together in one the children of God, that were dispersed.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=53-#x">
                [53]
               </a>
               From that day therefore they devised to put him to death.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=54-#x">
                [54]
               </a>
               Wherefore Jesus walked no more openly among the Jews; but he went into a country near the desert, unto a city that is called Ephrem, and there he abode with his disciples.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=55-#x">
                [55]
               </a>
               And the pasch of the Jews was at hand; and many from the country went up to Jerusalem, before the pasch to purify themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=11&amp;l=56-#x">
                [56]
               </a>
               They sought therefore for Jesus; and they discoursed one with another, standing in the temple: What think you that he is not come to the festival day? And the chief priests and Pharisees had given a commandment, that if any man knew where he was, he should tell, that they might apprehend him.

               Jesus therefore, six days before the pasch, came to Bethania, where Lazarus had been dead, whom Jesus raised to life.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=12&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]

               And they made him a supper there: and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that were at table with him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=12&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]

               Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of right spikenard, of great price, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=12&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]

               Then one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, he that was about to betray him, said:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=12&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=12&amp;l=6-#x">
                [6]
               </a>
               Now he said this, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the purse, carried the things that were put therein.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=12&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]

               Jesus therefore said: Let her alone, that she may keep it against the day of my burial.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=12&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]

               A great multitude therefore of the Jews knew that he was there; and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=12&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]

               : Viz., in a visible manner, as when conversant here on earth; and as we have the poor, whom we may daily assist and relieve.

              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=12&amp;l=11-#x">
                [11]
               </a>
               Because many of the Jews, by reason of him, went away, and believed in Jesus.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=12&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               And on the next day, a great multitude that was to come to the festival day, when they had heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=12&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried: Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord, the king of Israel.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=12&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               And Jesus found a young ass, and sat upon it, as it is written:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=12&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy king cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=12&amp;l=16-#x">
                [16]
               </a>
               These things his disciples did not know at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things to him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=12&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               The multitude therefore gave testimony, which was with him, when he called Lazarus out of the grave, and raised him from the dead.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=12&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               For which reason also the people came to meet him, because they heard that he had done this miracle.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=12&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               The Pharisees therefore said among themselves: Do you see that we prevail nothing? behold, the whole world is gone after him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=12&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]
               </a>
               Now there were certain Gentiles among them, who came up to adore on the festival day.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=12&amp;l=21-#x">
                [21]
               </a>
               These therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying: Sir, we would see Jesus.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=12&amp;l=22-#x">
                [22]
               </a>
               Philip cometh, and telleth Andrew. Again Andrew and Philip told Jesus.

               But Jesus answered them, saying: The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.

               Jesus therefore said to them: Yet a little while, the light is among you. Walk whilst you have the light, that the darkness overtake you not. And he that walketh in darkness, knoweth not whither he goeth.

               However, many of the chief men also believed in him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, that they might not be cast out of the synagogue.

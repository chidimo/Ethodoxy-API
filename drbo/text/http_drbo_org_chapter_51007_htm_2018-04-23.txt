                [1]

               Then the high priest said: Are these things so?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=7&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]

               Who said: Ye men, brethren, and fathers, hear. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charan.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=7&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               And said to him: Go forth out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=7&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               Then he went out of the land of the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charan. And from thence, after his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein you now dwell.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=7&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               And he gave him no inheritance in it; no, not the pace of a foot: but he promised to give it him in possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=7&amp;l=6-#x">
                [6]
               </a>
               And God said to him: That his seed should sojourn in a strange country, and that they should bring them under bondage, and treat them evil four hundred years.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=7&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               And the nation which they shall serve will I judge, said the Lord; and after these things they shall go out, and shall serve me in this place.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=7&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]
               </a>
               And he gave him the covenant of circumcision, and so he begot Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begot Jacob; and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=7&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               And the patriarchs, through envy, sold Joseph into Egypt; and God was with him,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=7&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]
               </a>
               And delivered him out of all his tribulations: and he gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharao, the king of Egypt; and he appointed him governor over Egypt, and over all his house.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=7&amp;l=11-#x">
                [11]
               </a>
               Now there came a famine upon all Egypt and Chanaan, and great tribulation; and our fathers found no food.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=7&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               But when Jacob had heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent our fathers first:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=7&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               And at the second time, Joseph was known by his brethren, and his kindred was made known to Pharao.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=7&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               And Joseph sending, called thither Jacob, his father, and all his kindred, seventy-five souls.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=7&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               So Jacob went down into Egypt; and he died, and our fathers.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=7&amp;l=16-#x">
                [16]
               </a>
               And they were translated into Sichem, and were laid in the sepulchre, that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Hemor, the son of Sichem.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=7&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               And when the time of the promise drew near, which God had promised to Abraham, the people increased, and were multiplied in Egypt,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=7&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               Till another king arose in Egypt, who knew not Joseph.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=7&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               This same dealing craftily with our race, afflicted our fathers, that they should expose their children, to the end they might not be kept alive.

               At the same time was Moses born, and he was acceptable to God: who was nourished three months in his father's house.

               And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians; and he was mighty in his words and in his deeds.

               And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren, the children of Israel.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=7&amp;l=24-#x">

               And when he had seen one of them suffer wrong, he defended him; and striking the Egyptian, he avenged him who suffered the injury.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=7&amp;l=25-#x">

               And he thought that his brethren understood that God by his hand would save them; but they understood it not.

               And the day following, he shewed himself to them when they were at strife; and would have reconciled them in peace, saying: Men, ye are brethren; why hurt you one another?

               And Moses fled upon this word, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begot two sons.

               And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the desert of mount Sina, an angel in a flame of fire in a bush.

               And Moses seeing it, wondered at the sight. And as he drew near to view it, the voice of the Lord came unto him, saying:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=7&amp;l=32-#x">
                [32]

               I am the God of thy fathers; the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses being terrified, durst not behold.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=7&amp;l=33-#x">
                [33]

               And the Lord said to him: Loose the shoes from thy feet, for the place wherein thou standest, is holy ground.

               Seeing I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, and I will send thee into Egypt.

               This Moses, whom they refused, saying: Who hath appointed thee prince and judge? him God sent to be prince and redeemer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.

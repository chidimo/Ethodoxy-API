             And I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that I have often purposed to come unto you, (and have been hindered hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.

             For I am not ashamed of the gospel. For it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth, to the Jew first, and to the Greek.

              [17]

              [19]

              [20]

             For the invisible things of him, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made; his eternal power also, and divinity: so that they are inexcusable.

             Because that, when they knew God, they have not glorified him as God, or given thanks; but became vain in their thoughts, and their foolish heart was darkened.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=52&amp;ch=1&amp;l=22-#x">
              [22]

             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=52&amp;ch=1&amp;l=24-#x">
              [24]

             Wherefore God gave them up to the desires of their heart, unto uncleanness, to dishonour their own bodies among themselves.

             : Not by being author of their sins, but by withdrawing his grace, and so permitting them, in punishment of their pride, to fall into those shameful sins.

             Foolish, dissolute, without affection, without fidelity, without mercy.

             Who, having known the justice of God, did not understand that they who do such things, are worthy of death; and not only they that do them, but they also that consent to them that do them.

                [1]
               </a>
               Now I make known unto you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received, and wherein you stand;
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]
               </a>
               By which also you are saved, if you hold fast after what manner I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               For I delivered unto you first of all, which I also received: how that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day, according to the scriptures:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               And that he was seen by Cephas; and after that by the eleven.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=6-#x">
                [6]
               </a>
               Then he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at once: of whom many remain until this present, and some are fallen asleep.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               After that, he was seen by James, then by all the apostles.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]
               </a>
               And last of all, he was seen also by me, as by one born out of due time.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]
               </a>
               But by the grace of God, I am what I am; and his grace in me hath not been void, but I have laboured more abundantly than all they: yet not I, but the grace of God with me.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=11-#x">
                [11]
               </a>
               For whether I, or they, so we preach, and so you have believed.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               Now if Christ be preached, that he arose again from the dead, how do some among you say, that there is no resurrection of the dead?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen again.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               And if Christ be not risen again, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God: because we have given testimony against God, that he hath raised up Christ; whom he hath not raised up, if the dead rise not again.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=16-#x">
                [16]
               </a>
               For if the dead rise not again, neither is Christ risen again.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               And if Christ be not risen again, your faith is vain, for you are yet in your sins.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ, are perished.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]
               </a>
               But now Christ is risen from the dead, the firstfruits of them that sleep:
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=21-#x">
                [21]
               </a>
               For by a man came death, and by a man the resurrection of the dead.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=22-#x">
                [22]
               </a>
               And as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=23-#x">
                [23]
               </a>
               But every one in his own order: the firstfruits Christ, then they that are of Christ, who have believed in his coming.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=24-#x">
                [24]
               </a>
               Afterwards the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God and the Father, when he shall have brought to nought all principality, and power, and virtue.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=25-#x">
                [25]
               </a>
               For he must reign, until he hath put all his enemies under his feet.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=26-#x">
                [26]
               </a>
               And the enemy death shall be destroyed last: For he hath put all things under his feet. And whereas he saith,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=53&amp;ch=15&amp;l=27-#x">
                [27]
               </a>
               All things are put under him; undoubtedly, he is excepted, who put all things under him.

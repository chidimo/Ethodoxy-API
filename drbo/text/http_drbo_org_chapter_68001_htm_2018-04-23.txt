              [9]

              [14]

             Being assured that the laying away of this my tabernacle is at hand, according as our Lord Jesus Christ also hath signified to me.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=68&amp;ch=1&amp;l=15-#x">
              [15]
             </a>
             And I will endeavour, that you frequently have after my decease, whereby you may keep a memory of these things.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=68&amp;ch=1&amp;l=16-#x">
              [16]
             </a>
             For we have not by following artificial fables, made known to you the power, and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ; but we were eyewitnesses of his greatness.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=68&amp;ch=1&amp;l=17-#x">
              [17]
             </a>
             For he received from God the Father, honour and glory: this voice coming down to him from the excellent glory: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=68&amp;ch=1&amp;l=18-#x">
              [18]
             </a>
             And this voice we heard brought from heaven, when we were with him in the holy mount.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=68&amp;ch=1&amp;l=19-#x">
              [19]
             </a>
             And we have the more firm prophetical word: whereunto you do well to attend, as to a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=68&amp;ch=1&amp;l=20-#x">
              [20]
             </a>
             Understanding this first, that
             <u>
              no prophecy of scripture is made by private interpretation
             </u>
             .
            </p>
            <p class="note">
             [20]
             <u>
              "No prophecy of scripture is made by private interpretation"
             </u>
             : This shews plainly that the scriptures are not to be expounded by any one's private judgment or private spirit, because every part of the holy scriptures were written by men inspired by the Holy Ghost, and declared as such by the Church; therefore they are not to be interpreted but by the Spirit of God, which he hath left, and promised to remain with his Church to guide her in all truth to the end of the world. Some may tell us, that many of our divines interpret the scriptures: they may do so, but they do it always with a submission to the judgment of the Church, and not otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=68&amp;ch=1&amp;l=21-#x">
              [21]
             </a>
             For prophecy came not by the will of man at any time: but the holy men of God spoke, inspired by the Holy Ghost.

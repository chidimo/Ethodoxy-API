{"2 Thessalonians__02": {"3__A revolt": "This revolt, or falling off, is generally understood, by the ancient fathers, of a revolt from the Roman empire, which was first to be destroyed, before the coming of Antichrist. It may, perhaps, be understood also of a revolt of many nations from the Catholic Church; which has, in part, happened already, by means of Mahomet, Luther, &c., and it may be supposed, will be more general in the days of the Antichrist.", "3__The man of sin": "Here must be meant some particular man, as is evident from the frequent repetition of the Greek article'the man of sin, 'the son of perdition, 'the adversary or opposer. It agrees to the wicked and great Antichrist, who will come before the end of the world.", "4__In the temple": "Either that of Jerusalem which some think he will rebuild; or in some Christian church, which he will pervert to his own worshipas Mahomet has done by the churches of the east.", "10__God shall send": "That is God shall suffer them to be deceived by lying wonders, and false miracles, in punishment of their not entertaining the love of truth.", "14__Traditions": "See here that the unwritten traditions are no less to be received than their epistles."}}

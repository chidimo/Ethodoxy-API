{"Deuteronomy__22": {"6__Thou shalt not take": "This was to shew them to exercise a certain mercy even to irrational creatures; and by that means to train them up to a horror of cruelty; and to the exercise of humanity and mutual charity one to another.", "8__Battlement": "This precaution was necessary, because all their houses had flat tops, and it was usual to walk and to converse together upon them."}}

{"Ecclesiastes__11": {"3__If the tree fall": "The state of the soul is unchangeable when once she comes to heaven or helland a soul that departs this life in the state of grace, shall never fall from graceas on the other side, a soul that dies out of the state of grace, shall never come to it. But this does not exclude a place of temporal punishments for such souls as die in the state of graceyet not so as to be entirely pureand therefore they shall be saved, indeed, yet so as by fire. 1 Cor. 3. 13, 14, 15."}}

{"Job__01": {"1__Hus": "The land of Hus was a part of Edom; as appears from Lam. 4. 21.-- Ibid.", "1__Simple": "That is, innocent, sincere, and without guile.", "4__And made a feast by houses": "That is, each made a feast in his own house and had his day, inviting the others, and their sisters.", "5__Blessed": "For greater horror of the very thought of blasphemy, the scripture both here and ver. 11, and in the following chapter, ver. 5 and 9, uses the word bless to signify its contrary.", "6__The sons of God": "The angels.-- Ibid. Satan also, etc. This passage represents to us in a figure, accommodated to the ways and understandings of men, 1. The restless endeavours of Satan against the servants of God; 2. That he can do nothing without God's permission; 3. That God doth not permit him to tempt them above their strengthbut assists them by his divine grace in such manner, that the vain efforts of the enemy only serve to illustrate their virtue and increase their merit."}}

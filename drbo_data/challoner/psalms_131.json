{"Psalms__131": {"6__We have heard of it in Ephrata": "When I was young, and lived in Bethlehem, otherwise called Ephrata, I heard of God's tabernacle and ark, and had a devout desire of seeking it; and accordingly I found it at Cariathiarim, the city of the woodswhere it was till it was removed to Jerusalem. See 1 Par. 13."}}

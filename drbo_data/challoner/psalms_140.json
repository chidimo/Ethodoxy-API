{"Psalms__140": {"5__Let not the oil of the sinner": "That is, the flattery, or deceitful praise.-- Ibid.", "5__For my prayer": "So far from coveting their praises, who are never well pleased but with things that are evil; I shall continually pray to be preserved from such things as they are delighted with.", "6__Their judges": "Their rulers, or chiefs, quickly vanish and perish, like ships dashed against the rocks, and swallowed up by the waves. Let them then hear my words, for they are powerful and will prevail; or, as it is in the Hebrew, for they are sweet.", "10__I am alone": "Singularly protected by the Almighty, until I pass all their nets and snares."}}

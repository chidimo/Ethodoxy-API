{"Psalms__54": {"16__Let death": "This, and such like imprecations which occur in the psalms, are delivered prophetically; that is, by way of foretelling the punishments which shall fall upon the wicked from divine justice, and approving the righteous ways of Godbut not by way of ill will, or uncharitable curses, which the law of God disallows.", "19__Among many": "That is, they that drew near to attack me were many in company all combined to fight against me.", "22__They are divided": "Dispersed, scattered, and brought to nothing, by the wrath of God; who looks with indignation on their wicked and deceitful ways."}}

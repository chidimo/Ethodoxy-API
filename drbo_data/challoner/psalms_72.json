{"Psalms__72": {"7__Fatness": "Abundance and temporal prosperity, which hath encouraged them in their iniquityand made them give themselves up to their irregular affections.", "10__Return here": "or hither. The weak among the servants of God, will be apt often to return to this thought, and will be shocked when they consider the full days, that is, the long and prosperous life of the wicked; and will be tempted to make the reflections against providence which are set down in the following verses.", "15__If I said": "That is, if I should indulge such thoughts as these.", "18__Thou hast put it to them": "In punishment of their deceits, or for deceiving them, thou hast brought evils upon them in their last end, which, in their prosperity they never apprehended."}}

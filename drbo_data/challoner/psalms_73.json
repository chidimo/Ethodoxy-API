{"Psalms__73": {"4__Their ensigns": "They have fixed their colours for signs and trophies, both on the gates, and on the highest top of the templeand they knew not, that is, they regarded not the sanctity of the place. This psalm manifestly foretells the time of the Machabees, and the profanation of the temple by Antiochus.", "13__The sea firm": "By making the waters of the Red Sea stand like firm walls, whilst Israel passed throughand destroying the Egyptians called here dragons from their cruelty, in the same waters, with their kingcasting up their bodies on the shore to be stripped by the Ethiopians inhabiting in those days the coast of Arabia.", "15__Ethan rivers": "That is, rivers which run with strong streams. This was verified in Jordan, Jos. 3, and in Arnon, Num. 21. 14.", "20__The obscure of the earth": "Mean and ignoble wretches have been filled, that is, enriched, with houses of iniquity, that is, with our estates and possessions, which they have unjustly acquired."}}

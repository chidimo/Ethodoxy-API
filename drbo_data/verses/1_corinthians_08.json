{"1 Corinthians__08": {"1": "Now concerning those things that are sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge.<u>\n                Knowledge puffeth up\n               </u>; but charity edifieth.", "2": "And if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he hath not yet known as he ought to know.", "3": "But if any man love God, the same is known by him.", "4": "But as for the meats that are sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God but one.", "5": "For although there be that are called gods, either in heaven or on earth (for there be<u>\n                gods many\n               </u>, and lords many).", "6": "Yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we unto him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.", "7": "But there is not knowledge in every one. For some until this present, with conscience of the idol: eat as a thing sacrificed to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.", "8": "But meat doth not commend us to God. For neither, if we eat, shall we have the more; nor, if we eat not, shall we have the less.", "9": "But take heed lest perhaps this your liberty become a stumblingblock to the weak.", "10": "For if a man see him that hath knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not his conscience, being weak, be emboldened to eat those things which are sacrificed to idols?", "11": "And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ hath died?", "12": "Now when you sin thus against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, you sin against Christ.", "13": "Wherefore,<u>\n                if meat scandalize\n               </u>my brother, I will never eat flesh, lest I should scandalize my brother."}}

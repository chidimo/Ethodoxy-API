{"1 Corinthians__11": {"1": "Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ.", "2": "Now I praise you, brethren, that in all things you are mindful of me: and keep my ordinances as I have delivered them to you.", "3": "But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.", "4": "Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered, disgraceth his head.", "5": "But every woman praying or prophesying with her head not covered, disgraceth her head: for it is all one as if she were shaven.", "6": "For if a woman be not covered, let her be shorn. But if it be a shame to a woman to be shorn or made bald, let her cover her head.", "7": "The man indeed ought not to cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man.", "8": "For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man.", "9": "For the man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man.", "10": "Therefore ought the woman to have<u>\n                a power\n               </u>over her head, because of the angels.", "11": "But yet neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord.", "12": "For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman: but all things of God.", "13": "You yourselves judge: doth it become a woman, to pray unto God uncovered?", "14": "Doth not even nature itself teach you, that a man indeed, if he nourish his hair, it is a shame unto him?", "15": "But if a woman nourish her hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her for a covering.", "16": "But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the church of God.", "17": "Now this I ordain: not praising you, that you come together not for the better, but for the worse.", "18": "For first of all I hear that when you come together in the church, there are schisms among you; and in part I believe it.", "19": "For<u>\n                there must be also heresies\n               </u>: that they also, who are approved, may be made manifest among you.", "20": "When you come therefore together into one place, it is not now to eat<u>\n                the Lord's supper\n               </u>.", "21": "For every one taketh before his own supper to eat. And one indeed is hungry and another is drunk.", "22": "What, have you not houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the church of God; and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? Do I praise you? In this I praise you not.", "23": "For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread.", "24": "And giving thanks, broke, and said: Take ye, and eat: this is my body, which shall be delivered for you: this do for the commemoration of me.", "25": "In like manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This chalice is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of me.", "26": "For as often as you shall eat this bread, and drink the chalice, you shall shew the death of the Lord, until he come.", "27": "Therefore whosoever shall eat this bread,<u>\n                or drink\n               </u>the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be<u>\n                guilty of the body\n               </u>and of the blood of the Lord.", "28": "But let a man prove himself: and so let him eat of that bread, and<u>\n                drink of the chalice\n               </u>.", "29": "For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord.", "30": "Therefore are there many infirm and weak among you, and many sleep.", "31": "But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.", "32": "But whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world.", "33": "Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.", "34": "If any man be hungry, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto judgment. And the rest I will set in order, when I come."}}

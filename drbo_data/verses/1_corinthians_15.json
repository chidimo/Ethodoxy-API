{"1 Corinthians__15": {"1": "Now I make known unto you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received, and wherein you stand;", "2": "By which also you are saved, if you hold fast after what manner I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain.", "3": "For I delivered unto you first of all, which I also received: how that Christ died for our sins, according to the scriptures:", "4": "And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day, according to the scriptures:", "5": "And that he was seen by Cephas; and after that by the eleven.", "6": "Then he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at once: of whom many remain until this present, and some are fallen asleep.", "7": "After that, he was seen by James, then by all the apostles.", "8": "And last of all, he was seen also by me, as by one born out of due time.", "9": "For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.", "10": "But by the grace of God, I am what I am; and his grace in me hath not been void, but I have laboured more abundantly than all they: yet not I, but the grace of God with me.", "11": "For whether I, or they, so we preach, and so you have believed.", "12": "Now if Christ be preached, that he arose again from the dead, how do some among you say, that there is no resurrection of the dead?", "13": "But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen again.", "14": "And if Christ be not risen again, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.", "15": "Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God: because we have given testimony against God, that he hath raised up Christ; whom he hath not raised up, if the dead rise not again.", "16": "For if the dead rise not again, neither is Christ risen again.", "17": "And if Christ be not risen again, your faith is vain, for you are yet in your sins.", "18": "Then they also that are fallen asleep in Christ, are perished.", "19": "If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.", "20": "But now Christ is risen from the dead, the firstfruits of them that sleep:", "21": "For by a man came death, and by a man the resurrection of the dead.", "22": "And as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive.", "23": "But every one in his own order: the firstfruits Christ, then they that are of Christ, who have believed in his coming.", "24": "Afterwards the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God and the Father, when he shall have brought to nought all principality, and power, and virtue.", "25": "For he must reign, until he hath put all his enemies under his feet.", "26": "And the enemy death shall be destroyed last: For he hath put all things under his feet. And whereas he saith,", "27": "All things are put under him; undoubtedly, he is excepted, who put all things under him.", "28": "And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then<u>\n                the Son also himself shall be subject unto him\n               </u>that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.", "29": "Otherwise what shall they do<u>\n                that are baptized for the dead\n               </u>, if the dead rise not again at all? why are they then baptized for them?", "30": "Why also are we in danger every hour?", "31": "I die daily, I protest by your glory, brethren, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.", "32": "If (according to man) I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me, if the dead rise not again?<u>\n                Let us eat and drink\n               </u>, for tomorrow we shall die.", "33": "Be not seduced: Evil communications corrupt good manners.", "34": "Awake, ye just, and sin not. For some have not the knowledge of God, I speak it to your shame.", "35": "But some man will say: How do the dead rise again? or with what manner of body shall they come?", "36": "Senseless man, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die first.", "37": "And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be; but bare grain, as of wheat, or of some of the rest.", "38": "But God giveth it a body as he will: and to every seed its proper body.", "39": "All flesh is not the same flesh: but one is the flesh of men, another of beasts, another of birds, another of fishes.", "40": "And there are bodies celestial, and bodies terrestrial: but, one is the glory of the celestial, and another of the terrestrial.", "41": "One is the glory of the sun, another the glory of the moon, and another the glory of the stars. For star differeth from star in glory.", "42": "So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it shall rise in incorruption.", "43": "It is sown in dishonour, it shall rise in glory. It is sown in weakness, it shall rise in power.", "44": "It is sown a natural body, it shall rise a spiritual body. If there be a natural body, there is also a spiritual body, as it is written:", "45": "The first man Adam was made into a living soul; the last Adam into a quickening spirit.", "46": "Yet that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; afterwards that which is spiritual.", "47": "The first man was of the earth, earthly: the second man, from heaven, heavenly.", "48": "Such as is the earthly, such also are the earthly: and such as is the heavenly, such also are they that are heavenly.", "49": "Therefore as we have borne the image of the earthly, let us bear also the image of the heavenly.", "50": "Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot possess the kingdom of God: neither shall corruption possess incorruption.", "51": "Behold, I tell you a mystery. We shall all indeed rise again: but we shall not all be changed.", "52": "In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall rise again incorruptible: and we shall be changed.", "53": "For this corruptible must put on incorruption; and this mortal must put on immortality.", "54": "And when this mortal hath put on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory.", "55": "O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?", "56": "Now the sting of death is sin: and the power of sin is the law.", "57": "But thanks be to God, who hath given us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.", "58": "Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast and unmoveable; always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labour is not in vain in the Lord."}}

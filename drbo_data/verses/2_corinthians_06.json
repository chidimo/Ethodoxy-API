{"2 Corinthians__06": {"1": "And we helping do exhort you, that you receive not the grace of God in vain.", "2": "For he saith: In an accepted time have I heard thee; and in the day of salvation have I helped thee. Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.", "3": "Giving no offence to any man, that our ministry be not blamed:", "4": "But in all things let us exhibit ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in tribulation, in necessities, in distresses,", "5": "In stripes, in prisons, in seditions, in labours, in watchings, in fastings,", "6": "In chastity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in sweetness, in the Holy Ghost, in charity unfeigned,", "7": "In the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armour of justice on the right hand and on the left;", "8": "By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet known;", "9": "As dying, and behold we live; as chastised, and not killed;", "10": "As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as needy, yet enriching many; as having nothing, and possessing all things.", "11": "Our mouth is open to you, O ye Corinthians, our heart is enlarged.", "12": "You are not straitened in us, but in your own bowels you are straitened.", "13": "But having the same recompense, (I speak as to my children,) be you also enlarged.", "14": "Bear not the yoke with unbelievers. For what participation hath justice with injustice? Or what fellowship hath light with darkness?", "15": "And what concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part hath the faithful with the unbeliever?", "16": "And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God; as God saith: I will dwell in them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.", "17": "Wherefore, Go out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing:", "18": "And I will receive you; and I will be a Father to you; and you shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty."}}

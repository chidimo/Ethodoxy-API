{"2 Samuel or 2 Kings__18": {"1": "And David having reviewed his people, appointed over them captains of thousands and of hundreds,", "2": "And sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abisai the son of Sarvia Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ethai, who was of Geth: and the king said to the people: I also will go forth with you.", "3": "And the people answered: Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not much mind us: or if half of us should fall, they will not greatly care: for thou alone art accounted for ten thousand: it is better therefore that thou shouldst be in the city to succour us.", "4": "And the king said to them: What seemeth good to you, that will I do. And the king stood by the gate: and all the people went forth by their troops, by hundreds and by thousands.", "5": "And the king commanded Joab, and Abisai, and Ethai, saying: Save me the boy Absalom. And all the people heard the king giving charge to all the princes concerning Absalom.", "6": "So the people went out into the field against Israel and the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim.", "7": "And the people of Israel were defeated there by David's army, and a great slaughter was made that day of twenty thousand men.", "8": "And the battle there was scattered over the face of all the country, and there were many more of the people whom the forest<u>consumed</u>, than whom the sword devoured that day.", "9": "And it happened that Absalom met the servants of David, riding on a mule: and as the mule went under a thick and large oak, his head stuck in the oak: and while he hung between the heaven and the earth, the mule on which he rode passed on.", "10": "And one saw this and told Joab, saying: I saw Absalom hanging upon an oak.", "11": "And Joab said to the man that told him: If thou sawest him, why didst thou not stab him to the ground, and I would have given thee ten sicles of silver, and belt?", "12": "And he said to Joab: If thou wouldst have paid down in my hands a thousand pieces of silver, I would not lay my hands upon the king's son: for in our hearing he king charged thee, and Abisai, and Ethai, saying: Save me the boy Absalom.", "13": "Yea and if I should have acted boldly against my own life, this could not have been hid from the king, and wouldst thou have stood by me?", "14": "And Joab said: Not as thou wilt, but will set upon him in thy sight. So he took three lances in his hand, and thrust them into the heart of Absalom: and whilst he yet panted for life, sticking on the oak,", "15": "Ten young men, armourbearers of Joab, ran up, and striking him slew him.", "16": "And Joab sounded the trumpet, and kept back the people from pursuing after Israel in their flight, being willing to spare the multitude.", "17": "And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the forest, and they laid an exceeding great heap of stories upon him: but all Israel fled to their own dwellings.", "18": "Now Absalom had reared up for himself, in his lifetime, a pillar, which is in the king's valley: for he said: I have<u>no son</u>, and this shall be the monument of my name. And he called the pillar by his own name, and it is called the hand of Absalom, to this day.", "19": "And Achimaas the son of Sadoc said: I will run and tell the king, that the Lord hath done judgment for him from the hand of his enemies.", "20": "And Joab said to him: Thou shalt not be the messenger this day, but shalt bear tidings another day: this day I will not have thee bear tidings, because the king's son is dead.", "21": "And Joab said to Chusai: Go, and tell the king what thou hast seen. Chusai bowed down to Joab, and ran.", "22": "Then Achimaas the son of Sadoc said to Joab again: Why might not I also run after Chusai? And Joab said to him: Why wilt thou run, my son? thou wilt not be the bearer of good tidings.", "23": "He answered: But what if I run? And he said to him: Run. Then Achimaas running by a nearer way passed Chusai.", "24": "And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman that was on the top of the gate upon the wall, lifting up his eyes, saw a man running alone.", "25": "And crying out he told the king: and the king said: If he be alone, there are good tidings in his mouth. And as he was coming apace, and drawing nearer,", "26": "The watchman saw another man running, and crying aloud from above, he said: I see another man running alone. And the king said: He also is a good messenger.", "27": "And the watchman said: The running of the foremost seemeth to me like the running of Achimaas the son of Sadoc. And the king said: He is a good man: and cometh with good news.", "28": "And Achimaas crying out, said to the king: God save thee, O king. And falling down before the king with his face to the ground, he said: Blessed be the Lord thy God, who hath shut up the men that have lifted up their hands against the lord my king.", "29": "And the king said: Is the young man Absalom safe? And Achimaas said: I saw a great tumult, O king, when thy servant Joab sent me thy servant: I know nothing else.", "30": "And the king said to him: Pass, and stand here.", "31": "And when he bad passed, and stood still, Chusai appeared: and coming up he said: I bring good tidings, my lord, the king, for the Lord hath judged for thee this day from the hand of all that have risen up against thee.", "32": "And the king said to Chusai: Is the young man Absalom safe? And Chusai answering him, said: Let the enemies of my lord, the king, and all that rise against him unto evil, be as the young man is.", "33": "The king therefore being much moved, went up to the high chamber over the gate, and wept. And as he went he spoke in this manner: My son Absalom, Absalom my son:<u>would to God</u>that I might die for thee, Absalom my son, my son Absalom."}}

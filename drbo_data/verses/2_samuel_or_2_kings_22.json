like the feet of harts, and setting me upon my high places.", "35": "He teacheth my bands to war: and maketh my arms like a bow of brass.", "36": "Thou hast given me the shield of my salvation: and

consume them.", "39": "I will consume them and break them in pieces, so that they shall not rise: they shall fall under my feet.", "40": "Thou hast girded me with strength to battle: thou hast made them that resisted me to bow under me.", "41": "My enemies thou hast made to turn their back to me: them that hated me, and I shall destroy them.", "42": "They shall cry, and there shall be none to save: to the Lord, and he shall not hear them.", "43": "I shall beat them as small as the dust of the earth: I shall crush them and spread them abroad like the mire of the streets.", "44": "Thou wilt save me from the contradictions of my people: thou wilt keep me to be the head of the Gentiles: the people which I know not, shall serve me,", "45": "The sons of the stranger will resist me, at the hearing of the ear they will obey me.", "46": "The strangers are melted away, and shall be straitened in their distresses.", "47": "The Lord liveth, and my God is blessed: and the strong God of my salvation shall be exalted:", "48": "God who giveth me revenge, and bringest down people under me,", "49": "Who bringest me forth from my enemies, and liftest me up from them that resist me: from the wicked man thou shalt deliver me.", "50": "Therefore will I give thanks to thee. O Lord, among the Gentiles, and will sing to thy name.", "51": "Giving great salvation to his king, and shewing mercy to David his anointed, and to his seed for ever."}}

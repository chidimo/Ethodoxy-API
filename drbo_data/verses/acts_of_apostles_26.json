{"Acts of Apostles__26": {"1": "Then Agrippa said to Paul: Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretching forth his hand, began to make his answer.", "2": "I think myself happy, O king Agrippa, that I am to answer for myself this day before thee, touching all the things whereof I am accused by the Jews.", "3": "Especially as thou knowest all, both customs and questions that are among the Jews: Wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.", "4": "And my life indeed from my youth, which was from the beginning among my own nation in Jerusalem, all the Jews do know:", "5": "Having known me from the beginning (if they will give testimony) that according to the most sure sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.", "6": "And now for the hope of the promise that was made by God to the fathers, do I stand subject to judgment:", "7": "Unto which, our twelve tribes, serving night and day, hope to come. For which hope, O king, I am accused by the Jews.", "8": "Why should it be thought a thing incredible, that God should raise the dead?", "9": "And I indeed did formerly think, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.", "10": "Which also I did at Jerusalem, and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority of the chief priests: and when they were put to death, I brought the sentence.", "11": "And oftentimes punishing them, in every synagogue, I compelled them to blaspheme: and being yet more mad against them, I persecuted them even unto foreign cities.", "12": "Whereupon when I was going to Damascus with authority and permission of the chief priest,", "13": "At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me, and them that were in company with me.", "14": "And when we were all fallen down on the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me in the Hebrew tongue: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the goad.", "15": "And I said: Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord answered: I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.", "16": "But rise up, and stand upon thy feet: for to this end have I appeared to thee, that I may make thee a minister, and a witness of those things which thou hast seen, and of those things wherein I will appear to thee,", "17": "Delivering thee from the people, and from the nations, unto which now I send thee:", "18": "To open their eyes, that they may be converted from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and a lot among the saints, by the faith that is in me.", "19": "Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not incredulous to the heavenly vision:", "20": "But to them first that are at Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and unto all the country of Judea, and to the Gentiles did I preach, that they should do penance, and turn to God, doing works worthy of penance.", "21": "For this cause the Jews, when I was in the temple, having apprehended me, went about to kill me.", "22": "But being aided by the help of God, I stand unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other thing than those which the prophets, and Moses did say should come to pass:", "23": "That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should shew light to the people, and to the Gentiles.", "24": "As he spoke these things, and made his answer, Festus said with a loud voice: Paul, thou art beside thyself: much learning doth make thee mad.", "25": "And Paul said: I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but I speak words of truth and soberness.", "26": "For the king knoweth of these things, to whom also I speak with confidence. For I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him. For neither was any of these things done in a corner.", "27": "Believest thou the prophets, O king Agrippa? I know that thou believest.", "28": "And Agrippa said to Paul: In a little thou persuadest me to become a Christian.", "29": "And Paul said: I would to God, that both in a little and in much, not only thou, but also all that hear me, this day, should become such as I also am, except these bands.", "30": "And the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them.", "31": "And when they were gone aside, they spoke among themselves, saying: This man hath done nothing worthy of death or of bands.", "32": "And Agrippa said to Festus: This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Caesar."}}

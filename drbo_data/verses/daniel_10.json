{"Daniel__10": {"1": "In the third year of Cyrus king of the Persians, a word was revealed to Daniel surnamed Baltassar, and a true word, and great strength: and he understood the word: for there is need of understanding in a vision.", "2": "In those days I Daniel mourned the days of three weeks.", "3": "I ate no desirable bread, and neither flesh, nor wine entered into my mouth, neither was I anointed with ointment: till the days of three weeks were accomplished.", "4": "And in the four and twentieth day of the first month I was by the great river which is the Tigris.", "5": "And I lifted up my eyes, and I saw: and behold a man clothed in linen, and his loins were girded with the finest gold:", "6": "And his body was like the chrysolite, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as a burning lamp: and his arms, and all downward even to the feet, like in appearance to glittering brass: and the voice of his word like the voice of a multitude.", "7": "And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw it not: but an exceeding great terror fell upon them, and they fled away, and hid themselves.", "8": "And I being left alone saw this great vision: and there remained no strength in me, and the appearance of my countenance was changed in me, and I fainted away, and retained no strength.", "9": "And I heard the voice of his words: and when I heard, I lay in a consternation, upon my face, and my face was close to the ground.", "10": "And behold a hand touched me, and lifted me up upon my knees, and upon the joints of my hands.", "11": "And he said to me: Daniel, thou man of desires, understand the words that I speak to thee, and stand upright: for I am sent now to thee. And when he had said this word to me, I stood trembling.", "12": "And he said to me: Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, to afflict thyself in the sight of thy God, thy words have been heard: and I am come for thy words.", "13": "But<u>the prince</u>of the kingdom of the Persians resisted me one and twenty days: and behold Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me, and I remained there by the king of the Persians.", "14": "But I am come to teach thee what things shall befall thy people in the latter days, for as yet the vision is for days.", "15": "And when he was speaking such words to me, I cast down my countenance to the ground, and held my peace.", "16": "And behold, as it were the likeness of a son of man touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said to him that stood before me: O my Lord, at the sight of thee my joints are loosed, and no strength hath remained in me.", "17": "And how can the servant of my lord speak with my lord? for no strength remaineth in me, moreover my breath is stopped.", "18": "Therefore he that looked like a man touched me again, and strengthened me.", "19": "And he said: Fear not, O man of desires, peace be to thee: take courage and be strong. And when he spoke to me, I grew strong: and I said: Speak, O my lord, for thou hast strengthened me.", "20": "And he said: Dost thou know wherefore I am come to thee? and now I will return, to fight against the prince of the Persians. When I went forth, there appeared the prince of the Greeks coming.", "21": "But I will tell thee what is set down in the scripture of truth: and none is my helper in all these things, but<u>Michael your prince</u>."}}

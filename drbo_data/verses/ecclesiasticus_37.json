{"Ecclesiasticus *__37": {"1": "Every friend will say: I also am his friend: but there is a friend, that is only a friend in name. Is not this a grief even to death?", "2": "But a companion and a friend shall be turned to an enemy.", "3": "O wicked presumption, whence camest thou to cover the earth with thy malice, and deceitfulness?", "4": "There is a companion who rejoiceth with his friend in his joys, but in the time of trouble, he will be against him.", "5": "There is a companion who condoleth with his friend for his belly's sake, and he will take up a shield against enemy.", "6": "Forget not thy friend in thy mind, and be not unmindful of him in thy riches.", "7": "Consult not with him that layeth a snare for thee, and hide thy counsel from them that envy thee.", "8": "Every counsellor giveth out counsel, but there is one that is a counsellor for himself.", "9": "Beware of a counsellor. And know before what need he hath: for he will devise to his own mind:", "10": "Lest he thrust a stake into the ground, and say to thee:", "11": "Thy way is good; and then stand on the other side to see what shall befall thee.", "12": "Treat not with a man without religion concerning holiness, nor with an unjust man concerning justice, nor with a woman touching her of whom she is jealous, nor with a coward concerning war, nor with a merchant about traffic, nor with a buyer of selling, nor with an envious man of giving thanks,", "13": "Nor with the ungodly of piety, nor with the dishonest of honesty, nor with the held labourer of every work,", "14": "Nor with him that worketh by the year of the finishing of the year, nor with an idle servant of much business: give no heed to these in any matter of counsel.", "15": "But be continually with a holy man, whomsoever thou shalt know to observe the fear of God,", "16": "Whose soul is according to thy own soul: and who, when thou shalt stumble in the dark, will be sorry for thee.", "17": "And establish within thyself a heart of good counsel: for there is no other thing of more worth to thee than it.", "18": "The soul of a holy man discovereth sometimes true things, more than seven watchmen that sit in a high piece to watch.", "19": "But above all these things pray to the most High, that he may direct thy way in truth.", "20": "In all thy works let the true word go before thee, and steady counsel before every action.", "21": "A wicked word shall change the beast: out of which four manner of things arise, good and evil, life and death: and the tongue is continually the ruler of them. There is a man that is subtle and a teacher of many, and yet is unprofitable to his own soul.", "22": "A skillful man hath taught many, and is sweet to his own soul.", "23": "He that speaketh sophistically, is hateful: he shall be destitute of every thing.", "24": "Grace is not given him from the Lord: for he is deprived of all wisdom.", "25": "There is a wise man that is wise to his own soul: and the fruit of his understanding is commendable.", "26": "A wise man instructeth his own people, and the fruits of his understanding are faithful.", "27": "A wise man shall be filled with blessings, and they that see shall praise him.", "28": "The life of a man is in the number of his days: but the days of Israel are innumerable.", "29": "A wise man shall inherit honour among his people, and his name shall live for ever.", "30": "My son, prove thy soul in thy life: and if it be wicked, give it no power:", "31": "For all things are not expedient for all, and every kind pleaseth not every soul.", "32": "Be not greedy in any feasting, and pour not out thyself upon any meat:", "33": "For in many meats there will be sickness, and greediness will turn to choler.", "34": "By surfeiting many have perished: but he that is temperate, shall prolong life."}}

{"Ephesians__05": {"1": "Be ye therefore followers of God, as most dear children;", "2": "And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath delivered himself for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to God for an odour of sweetness.", "3": "But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not so much as be named among you, as becometh saints:", "4": "Or obscenity, or foolish talking, or scurrility, which is to no purpose; but rather giving of thanks.", "5": "For know you this and understand, that no fornicator, or unclean, or covetous person (which is a serving of idols), hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.", "6": "Let no man deceive you with vain words. For because of these things cometh the anger of God upon the children of unbelief.", "7": "Be ye not therefore partakers with them.", "8": "For you were heretofore darkness, but now light in the Lord. Walk then as children of the light.", "9": "For the fruit of the light is in all goodness, and justice, and truth;", "10": "Proving what is well pleasing to God:", "11": "And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.", "12": "For the things that are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of.", "13": "But all things that are reproved, are made manifest by the light; for all that is made manifest is light.", "14": "Wherefore he saith: Rise thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead: and Christ shall enlighten thee.", "15": "See therefore, brethren, how you walk circumspectly: not as unwise,", "16": "But as wise: redeeming the time, because the days are evil.", "17": "Wherefore become not unwise, but understanding what is the will of God.", "18": "And be not drunk with wine, wherein is luxury; but be ye filled with the holy Spirit,", "19": "Speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual canticles, singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord;", "20": "Giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God and the Father:", "21": "Being subject one to another, in the fear of Christ.", "22": "Let women be subject to their husbands, as to the Lord:", "23": "Because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church. He is the saviour of his body.", "24": "Therefore as the<u>\n                church is subject to Christ\n               </u>, so also let the wives be to their husbands in all things.", "25": "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church, and delivered himself up for it:", "26": "That he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life:", "27": "That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy, and without blemish.", "28": "So also ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife, loveth himself.", "29": "For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as also Christ doth the church:", "30": "Because we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.", "31": "For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh.", "32": "This is a great sacrament; but I speak in Christ and in the church.", "33": "Nevertheless let every one of you in particular love his wife as himself: and let the wife fear her husband."}}

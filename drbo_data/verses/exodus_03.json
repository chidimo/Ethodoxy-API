{"Exodus__03": {"1": "Now Moses fed the sheep of Jethro his father in law, the priest of Madian: and he drove the flock to the inner parts of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, Horeb.", "2": "And<u>the Lord appeared</u>to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he saw that the bush was on fire and was not burnt.", "3": "And Moses said: I will go and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.", "4": "And when the Lord saw that he went forward to see, he called to him out of the midst of the bush, and said: Moses, Moses. And he answered: Here I am.", "5": "And he said: Come not nigh hither, put off the shoes from thy feet: for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground.", "6": "And he said: I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Moses hid his face: for he durst not look at God.", "7": "And the Lord said to him: I have seen the affliction of my people in Egypt, and I have heard their cry because of the rigour of them that are over the works:", "8": "And knowing their sorrow, I am come down to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians, and to bring them out of that land into a good and spacious land, into a land that floweth with milk and honey, to the places of the Chanaanite, and Hethite, and Amorrhite, and Pherezite, and Hevite, and Jebusite.", "9": "For the cry of the children of Israel is come unto me: and I have seen their affliction, wherewith they are oppressed by the Egyptians.", "10": "But come, and I will send thee to Pharao, that thou mayst bring forth my people, the children of Israel out of Egypt.", "11": "And Moses said to God: Who am I that I should go to Pharao, and should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt?", "12": "And he said to him: I will be with thee: and this thou shalt have for a sign, that I have sent thee: When thou shalt have brought my people out of Egypt, thou shalt offer sacrifice to God upon this mountain.", "13": "Moses said to God: Lo, I shall go to the children of Israel, and say to them: The God of your fathers hath sent me to you. If they should say to me: What is his name? what shall I say to them?", "14": "God said to Moses:<u>I AM WHO AM</u>.

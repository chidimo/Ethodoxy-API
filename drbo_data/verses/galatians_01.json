{"Galatians__01": {"1": "Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead,", "2": "And all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia.", "3": "Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,", "4": "Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present wicked world, according to the will of God and our Father:", "5": "To whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen.", "6": "I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, unto another gospel.", "7": "Which is not another, only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.", "8": "But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema.", "9": "As we said before, so now I say again: If any one preach to you a gospel, besides that which you have received, let him be anathema.", "10": "For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.", "11": "For I give you to understand, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.", "12": "For neither did I receive it of man, nor did I learn it; but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.", "13": "For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion: how that, beyond measure, I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it.", "14": "And I made progress in the Jews' religion above many of my equals in my own nation, being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.", "15": "But when it pleased him, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,", "16": "To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, immediately I condescended not to flesh and blood.", "17": "Neither went I to Jerusalem, to the apostles who were before me: but I went into Arabia, and again I returned to Damascus.", "18": "Then, after three years, I went to Jerusalem, to see Peter, and I tarried with him fifteen days.", "19": "But other of the apostles I saw none, saving James the brother of the Lord.", "20": "Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.", "21": "Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.", "22": "And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which were in Christ:", "23": "But they had heard only: He, who persecuted us in times past, doth now preach the faith which once he impugned:", "24": "And they glorified God in me."}}

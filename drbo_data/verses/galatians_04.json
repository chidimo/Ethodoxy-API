{"Galatians__04": {"1": "Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;", "2": "But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father:", "3": "So we also, when we were children, were serving<u>\n                under the elements\n               </u>of the world.", "4": "But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent his Son, made of a woman, made under the law:", "5": "That he might redeem them who were under the law: that we might receive the adoption of sons.", "6": "And because you are sons, God hath sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying: Abba, Father.", "7": "Therefore now he is not a servant, but a son. And if a son, an heir also through God.", "8": "But then indeed, not knowing God, you served them, who, by nature, are not gods.", "9": "But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known by God: how turn you again to the weak and needy elements, which you desire to serve again?", "10": "<u>\n                You observe days\n               </u>, and months, and times, and years.", "11": "I am afraid of you, lest perhaps I have laboured in vain among you.", "12": "Be ye as I, because I also am as you: brethren, I beseech you: you have not injured me at all.", "13": "And you know, how through infirmity of the flesh, I preached the gospel to you heretofore: and your temptation in my flesh,", "14": "You despised not, nor rejected: but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.", "15": "Where is then your blessedness? For I bear you witness, that, if it could be done, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and would have given them to me.", "16": "Am I then become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?", "17": "They are zealous in your regard not well: but they would exclude you, that you might be zealous for them.", "18": "But be zealous for that which is good in a good thing always: and not only when I am present with you.", "19": "My little children, of whom I am in labour again, until Christ be formed in you.", "20": "And I would willingly be present with you now, and change my voice: because I am ashamed for you.", "21": "Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, have you not read the law?", "22": "For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, and the other by a free woman.", "23": "But he who was of the bondwoman, was born according to the flesh: but he of the free woman, was by promise.", "24": "Which things are said by an allegory. For these are the two testaments. The one from mount Sina, engendering unto bondage; which is Agar:", "25": "For Sina is a mountain in Arabia, which hath affinity to that Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.", "26": "But that Jerusalem, which is above, is free: which is our mother.", "27": "For it is written: Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not: break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for many are the children of the desolate, more than of her that hath a husband.", "28": "Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.", "29": "But as then he, that was born according to the flesh, persecuted him that was after the spirit; so also it is now.", "30": "But what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son; for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman.", "31": "So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bondwoman, but of the free: by the freedom wherewith Christ has made us free."}}

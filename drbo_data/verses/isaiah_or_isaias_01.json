{"Isaiah or Isaias__01": {"1": "The vision of Isaias the son of Amos I which he saw concerning Juda and Jerusalem in the days of Ozias, Joathan, Achaz, and Ezechias, kings of Juda.", "2": "Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord hath spoken. I have brought up children, and exalted them: but they have despised me.", "3": "The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel hath not known me, and my people hath not understood.", "4": "Woe to the sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a wicked seed, ungracious children: they have forsaken the Lord, they have blasphemed the Holy One of Israel, they are gone away backwards.", "5": "For what shall I strike you any more, you that increase transgression? the whole head is sick, and the whole heart is sad.", "6": "From the sole of the foot unto the top of the head, there is no soundness therein: wounds and bruises and swelling sores: they are not bound up, nor dressed, nor fomented with oil.", "7": "Your land is desolate, your cities are burnt with fire: your country strangers devour before your face, and it shall be desolate as when wasted by enemies.", "8": "And the daughter of Sion shall be left as a covert in a vineyard, and as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, and as a city that is laid waste.", "9": "Except the Lord of hosts had left us seed, we had been as Sodom, and we should have been like to Gomorrha.", "10": "Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom, give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrha.", "11": "To what purpose do you offer me the multitude of your victims, saith the Lord? I am full, I desire not holocausts of rams, and fat of fatlings, and blood of calves, and lambs, and buck goats.", "12": "When you came to appear before me, who required these things at your hands, that you should walk in my courts?", "13": "Offer sacrifice no more in vain: incense is an abomination to me. The new moons, and the sabbaths, and other festivals I will not abide, your assemblies are wicked.", "14": "My soul hateth your new moons, and your solemnities: they are become troublesome to me, I am weary of bearing them.", "15": "And when you stretch forth your hands, I will turn away my eyes from you: and when you multiply prayer, I will not hear: for your hands are full of blood.", "16": "Wash yourselves, be clean, take away the evil of your devices from my eyes: cease to do perversely,", "17": "Learn to do well: seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge for the fatherless, defend the widow.", "18": "And then come, and accuse me, saith the Lord: if your sins be as scarlet, they shall be made as white as snow: and if they be red as crimson, they shall be white as wool.", "19": "If you be willing, and will hearken to me, you shall eat the good things of the land.", "20": "But if you will not, and will provoke me to wrath: the sword shall devour you because the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.", "21": "How is the faithful city, that was full of judgment, become a harlot? justice dwelt in it, but now murderers.", "22": "Thy silver is turned into dross: thy wine is mingled with water.", "23": "Thy princes are faithless, companions of thieves: they all love bribes, the run after rewards. They judge not for the fatherless: and the widow's cometh not in to them.", "24": "Therefore saith the Lord the God of hosts, the mighty one of Israel: Ah! I will comfort myself over my adversaries: and I will be revenged of my enemies.", "25": "And I will turn my hand to thee, and I will clean purge away thy dross, and I will take away all thy tin.", "26": "And I will restore thy judges as they were before, and thy counsellors as of old. After this thou shalt be called the city of the just, a faithful city.", "27": "Sion shall be redeemed in judgment, and they shall bring her back in justice.", "28": "And he shall destroy the wicked, and the sinners together: and they that have forsaken the Lord, shall be consumed.", "29": "For they shall be confounded for the idols, to which they have sacrificed: and you shall be ashamed of the gardens which you have chosen.", "30": "When you shall be as an oak with the leaves falling off, and as a garden without water.", "31": "And your strength shall be as the ashes of tow, and your work as a spark: and both shall burn together, and there shall be none to quench it."}}

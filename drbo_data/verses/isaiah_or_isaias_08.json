And the Lord said to me: Call his name, Hasten to take away the spoils: Make haste to take away the prey.", "4": "For before the child know to call his father and his mother, the strength of Damascus, and the spoils of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of the Assyrians.", "5": "And the Lord spoke to me again, saying:", "6": "Forasmuch as this people hath cast away the waters of Siloe, that go with silence, and hath rather taken Basin, and the son of Romelia:", "7": "Therefore behold the Lord will bring upon them the waters of the river strong and many, the king of the Assyrians, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and shall overflow all his banks,", "8": "And shall pass through Juda, overflowing, and going over shall reach even to the neck. And the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Emmanuel.", "9": "Gather yourselves together, O ye people, and be overcome, and give ear, all ye lands afar off: strengthen yourselves, and be overcome, gird yourselves, and be overcome.", "10": "Take counsel together, and it shall be defeated: speak a word, and it shall not be done: because God is with us.", "11": "For thus saith the Lord to me: As he hath taught me, with a strong arm, that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying:", "12": "Say ye not: A conspiracy: for all that this people speaketh, is a conspiracy: neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.", "13": "Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself: and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.", "14": "And he shall be a sanctification to you.

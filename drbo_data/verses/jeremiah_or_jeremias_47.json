The fathers have not looked back to the children, for feebleness of hands,", "4": "Because of the coming of the day, in which all the Philistines shall be laid waste, and Tyre and Sidon shall be destroyed, with all the rest of their helpers. For the Lord hath wasted the Philistines, the remnant of the isle of Cappadocia.", "5": "Baldness is come upon Gaza: Ascalon hath held her peace with the remnant of their valley: how long shalt thou cut thyself?", "6": "O thou sword of the Lord, how long wilt thou not be quiet?

{"Job__14": {"1": "Man born of a woman, living for a short time, is filled with many miseries.", "2": "Who cometh forth like a flower, and is destroyed, and fleeth as a shadow, and never continueth in the same state.", "3": "And dost thou think it meet to open thy eyes upon such an one, and to bring him into judgment with thee?", "4": "Who can make him clean that is conceived of unclean seed? is it not thou who only art?", "5": "The days of man are short, and the number of his months is with thee: thou hast appointed his bounds which cannot be passed.", "6": "Depart a little from him, that he may rest, until his wished for day come, as that of the hireling.", "7": "A tree hath hope: if it be cut, it groweth green again, and the boughs thereof sprout.", "8": "If its root be old in the earth, and its stock be dead in the dust:", "9": "At the scent of water, it shall spring, and bring forth leaves, as when it was first planted.", "10": "But man when he shall be dead, and stripped and consumed, I pray you where is he?", "11": "As if the waters should depart out of the sea, and an emptied river should be dried up:", "12": "So man when he is fallen asleep shall not rise again; till the heavens be broken, he shall not awake, nor rise up out of his sleep.", "13": "Who will grant me this,<u>\n                that thou mayst protect me in hell\n               </u>, and hide me till thy wrath pass, and appoint me a time when thou wilt remember me?", "14": "Shall man that is dead, thinkest thou, live again? all the days in which I am now in warfare, I expect until my change come.", "15": "Thou shalt call me, and I will answer thee: to the work of thy hands thou shalt reach out thy right hand.", "16": "Thou indeed hast numbered my steps, but spare my sins.", "17": "Thou hast sealed up my offences as it were in a bag, but hast cured my iniquity.", "18": "A mountain falling cometh to nought, and a rock is removed out of its place.", "19": "Waters wear away the stones, and with inundation the ground by little and little is washed away: so in like manner thou shalt destroy man.", "20": "Thou hast strengthened him for a little while, that he may pass away for ever: thou shalt change his face, and shalt send him away.", "21": "Whether his children come to honour or dishonour, he shall not understand.", "22": "But yet his flesh, while he shall live, shall have pain, and his soul shall mourn over him."}}

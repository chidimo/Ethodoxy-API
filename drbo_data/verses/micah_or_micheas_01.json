What is the wickedness of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Juda? are they not Jerusalem?", "6": "And I will make Samaria as a heap of stones in the field when a vineyard is planted: and I will bring down the stones thereof into the valley, and will lay her foundations bare.", "7": "And all her graven things shall be cut in pieces, and all<u>\n              her wages\n             </u>shall be burnt with fire, and I will bring to destruction all her idols: for they were gathered together<u>\n              of the hire of a harlot\n             </u>, and unto the hire of a harlot they shall return.", "8": "Therefore will I lament and howl: I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons, and a mourning like the ostriches.", "9": "Because her wound is desperate, because it is come even to Juda,<u>\n              it hath touched the gate\n             </u>of my people even to Jerusalem.", "10": "<u>\n              Declare ye it not in Geth\n             </u>,<u>\n              weep ye not\n             </u>with tears: in the house of Dust sprinkle yourselves with dust.", "11": "And pass away, O<u>\n              thou that dwellest in the Beautiful place\n             </u>, covered with thy shame:<u>\n              she went not forth\n             </u>that dwelleth in the confines:<u>\n              the House adjoining\n             </u>shall receive mourning from you, which stood by herself.", "12": "For<u>\n              she is become weak\n             </u>unto good that dwelleth in bitterness: for evil is come down from the Lord into the gate of Jerusalem.", "13": "A tumult of chariots hath astonished the inhabitants of Lachis:<u>\n              it is the beginning\n             </u>of sin to the daughter of Sion, for in thee were found the crimes of Israel.", "14": "<u>\n              Therefore shall she send\n             </u>messengers to the inheritance of Geth: the houses of lying to deceive the kings of Israel.", "15": "Yet will I bring<u>\n              an heir\n             </u>to thee that dwellest in Maresa: even to Odollam shall the glory of Israel come.", "16": "Make thee bald, and be polled for thy delicate children: enlarge thy baldness as the eagle: for they are carried into captivity from thee."}}

The day of thy inspection, thy visitation cometh: now shall be their destruction.", "5": "Believe not a friend, and trust not in a prince: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that sleepeth in thy bosom.", "6": "For the son dishonoureth the father, and the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in law: and a man's enemies are they of his own household.", "7": "But I will look towards the Lord, I will wait for God my Saviour: my God will hear me.", "8": "Rejoice not, thou, my enemy, over me, because I am fallen: I shall arise, when I sit in darkness, the Lord is my light.", "9": "I will bear the wrath of the Lord, because I have sinned against him; until he judge my cause and execute judgment for me: he will bring me forth into the light, I shall behold his justice.", "10": "And my enemy shall behold, and<u>she shall be covered</u>with shame, who saith to me: Where is the Lord thy God? My eyes shall look down upon her: now shall she be trodden under foot as the mire of the streets.", "11": "The day shall come, that thy walls may be built up: in that day shall<u>the law</u>be far removed.", "12": "In that day they shall come even from Assyria to thee, and to the fortified cities: and from the fortified cities even to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.", "13": "And<u>the land</u>shall be made desolate, because of the inhabitants thereof, and for the fruit of their devices.", "14": "Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thy inheritance, them that dwell alone in the forest, in the midst of Carmel: they shall feed in Basan and Galaad according to the days of old.", "15": "According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt I will shew him wonders.", "16": "The nations shall see, and shall be confounded at all their strength: they shall put the hand upon the mouth, their ears shall be deaf.", "17": "They shall lick the dust like serpents, as the creeping things of the earth, they shall be disturbed in their houses: they shall dread the Lord our God, and shall fear thee.", "18": "Who is a God like to thee, who takest away iniquity, and passest by the sin of the remnant of thy inheritance? he will send his fury in no more, because he delighteth in mercy.", "19": "He will turn again, and have mercy on us: he will put away our iniquities: and he will cast all our sins into the bottom of the sea.", "20": "Thou wilt perform the truth of Jacob, the mercy to Abraham: which thou hast sworn to our fathers from the days of old."}}

Why are we kept back that we may not offer in its season the offering to the Lord among the children of Israel?", "8": "And Moses answered them: Stay that I may consult the Lord what he will ordain concerning you.", "9": "And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying:", "10": "Say to the children of Israel: The man that shall be unclean by occasion of one that is dead, or shall be in a journey afar off in your nation, let him make the phase to the Lord.", "11": "In the second month, on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening, they shall eat it with unleavened bread and wild lettuce:", "12": "They shall not leave any thing thereof until morning, a nor break a bone thereof, they shall observe all the ceremonies of the phase.", "13": "But if any man is clean, and was not on a journey, and did not make the phase, that soul shall be cut off from among his people, because he offered not sacrifice to the Lord in due season: he shall bear his sin.", "14": "The sojourner also and the stranger if they be among you, shall make the phase to the Lord according to the ceremonies and justifications thereof.

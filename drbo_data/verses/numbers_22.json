{"Numbers__22": {"1": "And they went forward and encamped in the plains of Moab, over against where Jericho is situate beyond the Jordan.", "2": "And Balac the son of Sephor, seeing all that Israel had done to the Amorrhite,", "3": "And that the Moabites were in great fear of him, and were not able to sustain his assault,", "4": "He said to the elders of Madian: So will this people destroy all that dwell in our borders, as the ox is wont to eat the grass to the very roots. Now he was at that time king in Moab.", "5": "He sent therefore messengers to Balaam the son of Beer, a soothsayer, who dwelt by the river of the land of the children of Ammon, to call him, and to say: Behold a people is come out of Egypt, that hath covered the face of the earth, sitting over against me.", "6": "Come therefore, and curse this people, because it is mightier than I: if by any means I may beat them and drive them out of my land: for I know that he whom thou shalt bless is blessed, and he whom thou shalt curse is cursed.", "7": "And the ancients of Moab, and the elders of Madian, went with the price of divination in their hands. And when they were come to Balaam, and had told him all the words of Balac:", "8": "He answered: Tarry here this night, and I will answer whatsoever the Lord shall say to me. And while they stayed with Balaam, God came and said to him:", "9": "What mean these men that are with thee?", "10": "He answered: Balac the son of Sephor king of the Moabites hath sent to me,", "11": "Saying: Behold a people that is come out of Egypt, hath covered the face of the land: come and curse them, if by any means I may fight with them and drive them away.", "12": "And God said to Balaam: Thou shalt not go with them, nor shalt thou curse the people: because it is blessed.", "13": "And he rose in the morning and said to the princes: Go into your country, because the Lord hath forbid me to come with you.", "14": "The princes returning, said to Balac: Balaam would not come with us.", "15": "Then he sent many more and more noble than he had sent before:", "16": "Who, when they were come to Balaam, said: Thus saith Balac the son of Sephor, Delay not to come to me:", "17": "For I am ready to honour thee, and will give thee whatsoever thou wilt: come and curse this people.", "18": "Balaam answered: If Balac would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot alter the word of the Lord my God, to speak either more or less.", "19": "I pray you<u>\n                to stay\n               </u>here this night also, that I may know what the Lord will answer me once more.", "20": "God therefore came to Balaam in the night, and said to him: It these men be come to call thee, arise and go with them: yet so, that thou do what I shall command thee.", "21": "Balaam arose in the morning, and saddling his ass went with them.", "22": "And God was angry.

Why strikest thou me, lo, now this third time?", "29": "Balaam answered: Because thou hast deserved it, and hast served me ill: I would I had a sword that I might kill thee.", "30": "The ass said: Am not I thy beast, on which thou hast been always accustomed to ride until this present day? tell me if I ever did the like thing to thee. But he said: Never.", "31": "Forthwith the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel standing in the way with a drawn sword, and he worshipped him falling flat on the ground.", "32": "And the angel said to him: Why beatest thou thy ass these three times?

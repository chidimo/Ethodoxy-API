{"Proverbs__06": {"1": "My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, thou hast engaged fast thy hand to a stranger.", "2": "Thou art ensnared with the words of thy mouth, and caught with thy own words.", "3": "Do therefore, my son, what I say, and deliver thyself: because thou art fallen into the hand of thy neighbour. Run about, make haste, stir up thy friend:", "4": "Give not sleep to thy eyes, neither let thy eyelids slumber.", "5": "Deliver thyself as a doe from the hand, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.", "6": "Go to the ant, O sluggard, and consider her ways, and learn wisdom:", "7": "Which, although she hath no guide, nor master, nor captain,", "8": "Provideth her meat for herself in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.", "9": "How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou rise out of thy sleep?", "10": "Thou wilt sleep a little, thou wilt slumber a little, thou wilt fold thy hands a little to sleep:", "11": "And want shall come upon thee, as a traveller, and poverty as a man armed. But if thou be diligent, thy harvest shall come as a fountain, and want shall flee far from thee.", "12": "A man that is an apostate, an unprofitable man, walketh with a perverse mouth,", "13": "He winketh with the eyes, presseth with the foot, speaketh with the finger.", "14": "With a wicked heart he deviseth evil, and at all times he soweth discord.", "15": "To such a one his destruction shall presently come, and he shall suddenly be destroyed, and shall no longer have any remedy.", "16": "Six things there are, which the Lord hateth, and the seventh his soul detesteth:", "17": "Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood,", "18": "A heart that deviseth wicked plots, feet that are swift to run into mischief,", "19": "A deceitful witness that uttereth lies, and him that soweth discord among brethren.", "20": "My son, keep the commandments of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother.", "21": "Bind them in thy heart continually, and put them about thy neck.", "22": "When thou walkest, let them go with thee: when thou sleepest, let them keep thee; and when thou awakest, talk with them.", "23": "Because the commandment is a lamp, and the law a light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:", "24": "That they may keep thee from the evil woman, and from the flattering tongue of the stranger.", "25": "Let not thy heart covet her beauty, be not caught with her winks:", "26": "For the price of a harlot is scarce one loaf: but the woman catcheth the precious soul of a man.", "27": "Can a man hide fire in his bosom, and his garments not burn?", "28": "Or can he walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be burnt?", "29": "So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife, shall not be clean when he shall touch her.", "30": "<u>\n                The fault is not so great\n               </u>when a man hath stolen: for he stealeth to fill his hungry soul:", "31": "And if he be taken he shall restore sevenfold, and shall give up all the substance of his house.", "32": "But he that is an adulterer, for the folly of his heart shall destroy his own soul:", "33": "He gathereth to himself shame and dishonour, and his reproach shall not be blotted out:", "34": "Because the jealousy and rage of the husband will not spare in the day of revenge,", "35": "Nor will he yield to any man's prayers, nor will he accept for satisfaction ever so many gifts."}}

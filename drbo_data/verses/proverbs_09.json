{"Proverbs__09": {"1": "Wisdom hath built herself a house, she hath hewn her out seven pillars.", "2": "She hath slain her victims, mingled her wine, and set forth her table.", "3": "She hath sent her maids to invite to the tower, and to the walls of the city:", "4": "Whosoever is a little one, let him come to me. And to the unwise she said:", "5": "Come, eat my bread, and drink the wine which I have mingled for you.", "6": "Forsake childishness, and live, and walk by the ways of prudence.", "7": "He that teacheth a scorner, doth an injury to himself: and he that rebuketh a wicked man, getteth himself a blot.", "8": "Rebuke not a scorner lest he hate thee. Rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.", "9": "Give an occasion to a wise man, and wisdom shall be added to him. Teach a just man, and he shall make haste to receive it.", "10": "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is prudence.", "11": "For by me shall thy days be multiplied, and years of life shall be added to thee.", "12": "If thou be wise, thou shalt be so to thyself: and if a scorner, thou alone shalt bear the evil.", "13": "A foolish woman and clamorous, and full of allurements, and knowing nothing at all,", "14": "Sat at the door of her house, upon a seat, in a high place of the city,", "15": "To call them that pass by the way, and go on their journey:", "16": "He that is a little one, let him turn to me. And to the fool she said:", "17": "Stolen waters are sweeter, and hidden bread is more pleasant.", "18": "And he did not know that giants are there, and that her guests are in the depths of hell."}}

{"Proverbs__26": {"1": "As snow in summer, and rain in harvest, so glory is not seemly for a fool.", "2": "<u>\n                As a bird\n               </u>flying to other places, and a sparrow going here or there: so a curse uttered without cause shall come upon a man.", "3": "A whip for a horse, and a snaffle for an ass, and a rod for the back of fools.", "4": "<u>\n                Answer not a fool\n               </u>according to his folly, lest thou be made like him.", "5": "Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he imagine himself to be wise.", "6": "He that sendeth words by a foolish messenger, is lame of feet and drinketh iniquity.", "7": "As a lame man hath fair legs in vain: so a parable is unseemly in the mouth of fools.", "8": "As he that casteth a stone into the heap of Mercury: so is he that giveth honour to a fool.", "9": "As if a thorn should grow in the hand of a drunkard: so is a parable in the mouth of fools.", "10": "Judgment determineth causes: and he that putteth a fool to silence, appeaseth anger.", "11": "As a dog that returneth to his vomit, so is the fool that repeateth his folly.", "12": "Hast thou seen a man wise in his own conceit? there shall be more hope of a fool than of him.", "13": "The slothful man saith: There is a lion in the way, and a lioness in the roads.", "14": "As the door turneth upon its hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed.", "15": "The slothful hideth his hand under his armpit, and it grieveth him to turn it to his mouth.", "16": "The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit, than seven men that speak sentences.", "17": "As he that taketh a dog by the ears, so is he that passeth by in anger, and meddleth with another man's quarrel.", "18": "As he is guilty that shooteth arrows, and lances unto death:", "19": "So is the man that hurteth his friend deceitfully: and when he is taken, saith: I did it in jest.", "20": "When the wood faileth, the fire shall go out: and when the talebearer is taken away, contentions shall cease.", "21": "As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire, so an angry man stirreth up strife.", "22": "The words of a talebearer are as it were simple, but they reach to the innermost parts of the belly.", "23": "Swelling lips joined with a corrupt heart, are like an earthen vessel adorned with silver dross.", "24": "An enemy is known by his lips, when in his heart he entertaineth deceit.", "25": "When he shall speak low, trust him not: because there are seven mischiefs in his heart.", "26": "He that covereth hatred deceitfully, his malice shall be laid open in the public assembly.", "27": "He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: and he that rolleth a stone, it shall return to him.", "28": "A deceitful tongue loveth not truth: and a slippery mouth worketh ruin."}}

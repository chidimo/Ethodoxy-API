{"Psalms__100": {"1": "A psalm for David himself. Mercy and judgment I will sing to thee, O Lord: I will sing,", "2": "And<u>\n                I will understand\n               </u>in the unspotted way, when thou shalt come to me. I walked in the innocence of my heart, in the midst of my house.", "3": "I did not set before my eyes any unjust thing: I hated the workers of iniquities.", "4": "The perverse heart did not cleave to me: and the malignant, that turned aside from me, I would not know.", "5": "The man that in private detracted his neighbour, him did I persecute. With him that had a proud eye, and an unsatiable heart, I would not eat.", "6": "My eyes were upon the faithful of the earth, to sit with me: the man that walked in the perfect way, he served me.", "7": "He that worketh pride shall not dwell in the midst of my house: he that speaketh unjust things did not prosper before my eyes.", "8": "In the morning I put to death all the wicked of the land: that I might cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the Lord."}}

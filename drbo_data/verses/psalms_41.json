{"Psalms__41": {"1": "Unto the end, understanding for the sons of Core.", "2": "As the hart panteth after the fountains of water; so my soul panteth after thee, O God.", "3": "My soul hath thirsted after the strong living God; when shall I come and appear before the face of God?", "4": "My tears have been my bread day and night, whilst it is said to me daily: Where is thy God?", "5": "These things I remembered, and poured out my soul in me: for I shall go over into the place of the wonderful tabernacle, even to the house of God: With the voice of joy and praise; the noise of one feasting.", "6": "Why art thou sad, O my soul? and why dost thou trouble me? Hope in God, for I will still give praise to him: the salvation of my countenance,", "7": "And my God. My soul is troubled within myself: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan and Hermoniim, from the little hill.", "8": "Deep calleth on deep, at the noise of thy flood-gates. All thy heights and thy billows have passed over me.", "9": "In the daytime the Lord hath commanded his mercy; and a canticle to him in the night. With me is prayer to the God of my life.", "10": "I will say to God: Thou art my support. Why hast thou forgotten me? and why go I mourning, whilst my enemy afflicteth me?", "11": "Whilst my bones are broken, my enemies who trouble me have reproached me; Whilst they say to me day be day: Where is thy God?", "12": "Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why dost thou disquiet me? Hope thou in God, for I will still give praise to him: the salvation of my countenance, and my God."}}

{"Psalms__98": {"1": "A psalm for David himself. The Lord hath reigned,<u>\n                let the people be angry\n               </u>: he that sitteth on the cherubims: let the earth be moved.", "2": "The Lord is great in Sion, and high above all people.", "3": "Let them give praise to thy great name: for it is terrible and holy:", "4": "And the king's honour<u>\n                loveth judgment\n               </u>. Thou hast prepared<u>\n                directions\n               </u>: thou hast done judgment and justice in Jacob.", "5": "Exalt ye the Lord our God, and<u>\n                adore his footstool\n               </u>, for it is holy.", "6": "<u>\n                Moses and Aaron among his priests\n               </u>: and Samuel among them that call upon his name. They called upon the Lord, and he heard them:", "7": "He spoke to them in the pillar of the cloud. They kept his testimonies, and the commandment which he gave them.", "8": "Thou didst hear them, O Lord our God: thou wast a merciful God to them, and taking vengeance on<u>\n                all their inventions\n               </u>.", "9": "Exalt ye the Lord our God, and adore at his holy mountain: for the Lord our God is holy."}}

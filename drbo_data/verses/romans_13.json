{"Romans__13": {"1": "Let every soul be subject to higher powers: for there is no power but from God: and those that are, are ordained of God.", "2": "Therefore he that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God. And they that resist, purchase to themselves damnation.", "3": "For princes are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good: and thou shalt have praise from the same.", "4": "For he is God's minister to thee, for good. But if thou do that which is evil, fear: for he beareth not the sword in vain. For he is God's minister: an avenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.", "5": "Wherefore be subject of necessity, not only for wrath, but also for conscience' sake.", "6": "For therefore also you pay tribute. For they are the ministers of God, serving unto this purpose.", "7": "Render therefore to all men their dues. Tribute, to whom tribute is due: custom, to whom custom: fear, to whom fear: honour, to whom honour.", "8": "Owe no man any thing, but to love one another. For he that loveth his neighbour, hath fulfilled the law.", "9": "For Thou shalt not commit adultery: Thou shalt not kill: Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness: Thou shalt not covet: and if there be any other commandment, it is comprised in this word, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.", "10": "The love of our neighbour worketh no evil. Love therefore is the fulfilling of the law.", "11": "And that knowing the season; that it is now the hour for us to rise from sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than when we believed.", "12": "The night is passed, and the day is at hand. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and put on the armour of light.", "13": "Let us walk honestly, as in the day: not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and impurities, not in contention and envy:", "14": "But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh in its concupiscences."}}

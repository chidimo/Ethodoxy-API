               And when Rebecca had heard this, and he was gone into the field to fulfill his father's commandment,

                [7]
               </a>
               Bring me of thy hunting, and make me meats that I may eat, and bless thee in the sight of the Lord, before I die.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=27&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]
               </a>
               Now, therefore, my son, follow my counsel:

                [9]

               And go thy way to the flock, bring me two kids of the best, that I may make of them meat for thy father, such as he gladly eateth:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=27&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]
               </a>
               Which when thou hast brought in, and he hath eaten, he may bless thee before he die.

               And he answered her: Thou knowest that Esau my brother is a hairy man, and I am smooth.

               If my father shall feel me, and perceive it, I fear lest he will think I would have mocked him, and I shall bring upon me a curse instead of a blessing.

                [13]

               And his mother said to him: Upon me be this curse, my son: only hear thou my voice, and go, fetch me the things which I have said.

               He went, and brought, and gave them to his mother. She dressed meats, such as she knew his father liked.

               And the little skins of the kids she put about his hands, and covered the bare of his neck.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=27&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               And she gave him the savoury meat, and delivered him bread that she had baked.

               And Isaac said to his son: How couldst thou find it so quickly, my son? He answered: It was the will of God, that what I sought came quickly in my way.

               : St. Augustine (L. Contra mendacium, c. 10), treating at large upon this place, excuseth Jacob from a lie, because this whole passage was mysterious, as relating to the preference which was afterwards to be given to the Gentiles before the carnal Jews, which Jacob by prophetic light might understand. So far is certain, that the first birthright, both by divine election and by Esau's free cession belonged to Jacob: so that if there were any lie in the case, it could be no more than an officious and venial one.

               He came near to his father, and when he had felt him, Isaac said: The voice indeed is the voice of Jacob; but the hands are the hands of Esau.

               He said to him: Come near me, and give me a kiss, my son.

               He came near, and kissed him. And immediately as he smelled the fragrant smell of his garments, blessing him, he said: Behold the smell of my son is as the smell of a plentiful field, which the Lord hath blessed.

               Isaac had scarce ended his words, when Jacob being now gone out abroad, Esau came,

               Isaac was struck with fear, and astonished exceedingly: and wondering beyond what can be believed, said Who is he then that even now brought me venison that he had taken, and I ate of all before thou camest? and I have blessed him, and he shall be blessed.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=27&amp;l=34-#x">

               Esau having heard his father's words, roared out with a great cry: and being in a great consternation, said: Bless me also, my father.

               Esau therefore always hated Jacob for the blessing wherewith his father had blessed him: and he said in his heart: The days will come of the mourning of my father, and I will kill my brother Jacob.

                [5]
               </a>
               And he asked them, saying: Know you Laban the son of Nachor? They said: We know him.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=6-#x">
                [6]
               </a>
               He said: Is he in health? He is in health, say they: and behold Rachel his daughter cometh with his flock.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               And Jacob said: There is yet much day remaining, neither is it time to bring the flocks into the folds again: first give the sheep drink, and so lead them back to feed.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]
               </a>
               They answered: We cannot, till all the cattle be gathered together, and we remove the stone from the well's mouth, that we may water the flocks.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               They were yet speaking, and behold Rachel came with her father's sheep: for she fed the flock.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]
               </a>
               And when Jacob saw her, and knew her to be his cousin-german, and that they were the sheep of Laban, his uncle: he removed the stone wherewith the well was closed.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=11-#x">
                [11]
               </a>
               And having watered the flock, he kissed her: and lifting up his voice, wept.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               And he told her that he was her father's brother, and the son of Rebecca: but she went in haste and told her father.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               Who, when he heard that Jacob his sister's son was come, ran forth to meet him; and embracing him, and heartily kissing him, brought him into his house. And when he had heard the causes of his journey,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               He answered: Thou art my bone and my flesh. And after the days of one month were expired,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               He said to him: Because thou art my brother, shalt thou serve me without wages? Tell me what wages thou wilt have.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=16-#x">
                [16]
               </a>
               Now he had two daughters, the name of the elder was Lia: and the younger was called Rachel.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               But Lia was blear eyed: Rachel was well favoured, and of a beautiful countenance.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               And Jacob being in love with her, said: I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               Laban answered: It is better that I give her to thee than to another man; stay with me.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]
               </a>
               So Jacob served seven years for Rachel: and they seemed but a few days, because of the greatness of his love.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=21-#x">
                [21]
               </a>
               And he said to Laban: Give me my wife; for now the time is fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=22-#x">
                [22]
               </a>
               And he, having invited a great number of his friends to the feast, made the marriage.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=23-#x">
                [23]
               </a>
               And at night he brought in Lia his daughter to him,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=24-#x">
                [24]
               </a>
               Giving his daughter a handmaid, named Zelpha. Now when Jacob had gone in to her according to custom when morning was come he saw it was Lia:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=25-#x">
                [25]
               </a>
               And he said to his father in law: What is it that thou didst mean to do? did not I serve thee for Rachel? why hast thou deceived me?
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=26-#x">
                [26]
               </a>
               Laban answered: It is not the custom in this place, to give the younger in marriage first.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=27-#x">
                [27]
               </a>
               Make up the week of days of this match: and I will give thee her also, for the service that thou shalt render me other seven years.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=28-#x">
                [28]
               </a>
               He yielded to his pleasure: and after the week was past, he married Rachel:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=29-#x">
                [29]
               </a>
               To whom her father gave Bala for her servant.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=30-#x">
                [30]
               </a>
               And having at length obtained the marriage he wished for, he preferred the love of the latter before the former, and served with him other seven years.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=31-#x">
                [31]
               </a>
               And the Lord seeing that he despised Lia, opened her womb, but her sister remained barren.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=32-#x">
                [32]
               </a>
               And she conceived and bore a son, and called his name Ruben, saying: The Lord saw my affliction: now my husband will love me.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=33-#x">
                [33]
               </a>
               And again she conceived and bore a son, and said: Because the Lord heard that I was despised, he hath given this also to me: and she called his name Simeon.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=34-#x">
                [34]
               </a>
               And she conceived the third time, and bore another son: and said: Now also my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons: and therefore she called his name Levi.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=1&amp;ch=29&amp;l=35-#x">
                [35]
               </a>
               The fourth time she conceived and bore a son, and said: now will I praise the Lord: and for this she called him Juda. And she left bearing.

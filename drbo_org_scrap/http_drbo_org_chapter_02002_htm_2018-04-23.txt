               Moses is born and exposed on the bank of the river; where he is taken up by the daughter of Pharao, and adopted for her son. He killeth an Egyptian, and fleeth into Madian; where he marrieth a wife.

               And when she could hide him no longer, she took a basket made of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and pitch: and put the little babe therein, and laid him in the sedges by the river's brink,

               She opened it and seeing within it an infant crying, having compassion on it she said: This is one of the babes of the Hebrews.

               She answered: Go. The maid went and called her mother.

               In those days after Moses was grown up, he went out to his brethren: and saw their affliction, and an Egyptian striking one of the Hebrews his brethren.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=2&amp;ch=2&amp;l=12-#x">

               And when he had looked about this way and that way, and saw no one there,
               <u>
                he slew the Egyptian
               </u>
               and hid him in the sand.

                [13]
               </a>
               And going out the next day, he saw two Hebrews quarrelling: and he said to him that did the wrong: Why strikest thou thy neighbour?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=2&amp;ch=2&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               But he answered: Who hath appointed thee prince and judge over us? Wilt thou kill me, as thou didst yesterday kill the Egyptian? Moses feared, and said: How is this come to be known?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=2&amp;ch=2&amp;l=15-#x">

               And Pharao heard of this word and sought to kill Moses: but he fled from his sight, and abode in the land of
               <u>
                Madian

               : This he did by a particular inspiration of God; as a prelude to his delivering the people from their oppression and bondage. He thought, says St. Stephen, Acts 7. 25, that his brethren understood that God by his hand would save them. But such particular and extraordinary examples are not to be imitated.

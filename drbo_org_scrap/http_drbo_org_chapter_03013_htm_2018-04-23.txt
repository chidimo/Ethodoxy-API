               The law concerning leprosy in men, and in garments.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=13&amp;l=1-#x">
                [1]
               </a>
               And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=13&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]
               </a>
               The man in whose skin or flesh shalt arise a different colour or a blister, or as it were something shining, that is, the stroke of the leprosy, shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or any one of his sons.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=13&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               And if he see the leprosy in his skin, and the hair turned white, and the place where the leprosy appears lower than the skin and the rest of the flesh: it is the stroke of the leprosy, and upon his judgment he shall be separated.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=13&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               But if there be a shining whiteness in the skin, and not lower than the other flesh, and the hair be of the former colour, the priest shall shut him up seven days.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=13&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               And the seventh day he shall look on him: and if the leprosy be grown no farther, and hath not spread itself in the skin, he shall shut him up again other seven days.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=13&amp;l=6-#x">
                [6]
               </a>
               And on the seventh day, he shall look on him: if the leprosy be somewhat obscure, and not spread in the skin, he shall declare him clean, because it is but a scab: and the man shall wash his clothes, and shall be clean.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=13&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               But if the leprosy grow again, after he was seen by the priest and restored to cleanness, he shall be brought to him,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=13&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]
               </a>
               And shall be condemned of uncleanness.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=13&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               If the stroke of the leprosy be in a man, he shall be brought to the priest,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=13&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]
               </a>
               And he shall view him. And when there shall be a white colour in the skin, and it shall have changed the look of the hair, and the living flesh itself shall appear:
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=13&amp;l=11-#x">
                [11]
               </a>
               It shall be judged an inveterate leprosy, and grown into the skin. The priest therefore shall declare him unclean, and shall not shut him up, because he is evidently unclean.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=13&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               But if the leprosy spring out running about in the skin, and cover all the skin from the head to the feet, whatsoever falleth under the sight of the eyes,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=13&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               The priest shall view him, and shall judge that the leprosy which he has is very clean: because it is all turned into whiteness, and therefore the man shall be clean.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=13&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               But when the live flesh shall appear in him,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=13&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               Then by the judgment of the priest he shall be defiled, and shall be reckoned among the unclean: for live flesh, if it be spotted with leprosy, is unclean.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=13&amp;l=16-#x">
                [16]
               </a>
               And if again it be turned into whiteness, and cover all the man,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=13&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               The priest shall view him, and shall judge him to be clean.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=13&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               When also there has been an ulcer in the flesh and the skin, and it has been healed,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=13&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               And in the place of the ulcer, there appeareth a white scar, or somewhat red, the man shall be brought to the priest:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=13&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]

               And when he shall see the place of the leprosy lower than the other flesh, and the hair turned white, he shall declare him unclean, for the plague of leprosy is broken out in the ulcer.

               And when he shall see that the former colour is not returned, nor yet the leprosy spread, he shall judge it unclean, and shall burn it with fire, for the leprosy has taken hold of the outside of the garment, or through the whole.

                [57]

               And if after this there appear in those places that before were without spot, a flying and wandering leprosy: it must be burnt with fire.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=13&amp;l=58-#x">
                [58]
               </a>
               If it cease, he shall wash with water the parts that are pure, the second time, and they shall be clean.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=3&amp;ch=13&amp;l=59-#x">

               This is the law touching the leprosy of any woollen or linen garment, either in the warp or woof, or any thing of skins, how it ought to be cleansed, or pronounced unclean.

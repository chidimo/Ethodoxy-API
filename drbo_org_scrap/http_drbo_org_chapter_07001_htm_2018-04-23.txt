             The expedition and victory of Juda against the Chanaanites: who are tolerated in many places.

              [1]
             </a>
             After the death of Josue the children of Israel consulted the Lord, saying: Who shall go up before us against the Chanaanite, and shall be the leader of the war?
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=1&amp;l=2-#x">
              [2]
             </a>
             And the Lord said: Juda shall go up: behold I have delivered the land into his hands.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=1&amp;l=3-#x">
              [3]
             </a>
             And Juda said to Simeon his brother: Come up with me into my lot, and fight against the Chanaanite, that I also may go along with thee into thy lot. And Simeon went with him.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=1&amp;l=4-#x">
              [4]
             </a>
             And Juda went up, and the Lord delivered the Chanaanite, and the Pherezite into their hands: and they slew of them in Bezec ten thousand men.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=1&amp;l=5-#x">
              [5]
             </a>
             And they found Adonibezec in Bezec, and fought against him, and they defeated the Chanaanite, and the Pherezite.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=1&amp;l=6-#x">
              [6]
             </a>
             And Adonibezec fled: and they pursued after him and took him, and cut off his fingers and toes.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=1&amp;l=7-#x">
              [7]
             </a>
             And Adonibezec said: Seventy kings having their fingers and toes cut off, gathered up the leavings of the meat under my table: as I have done, so hath God requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=1&amp;l=8-#x">
              [8]

             And the children of Juda besieging
             <u>
              Jerusalem
             </u>
             , took it, and put it to the sword, and set the whole city on fire.

              [9]
             </a>
             And afterwards they went down and fought against the Chanaanite, who dwelt in the mountains, and in the south, and in the plains.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=1&amp;l=10-#x">
              [10]

             : This city was divided into two; one part was called Jebus, the other Salem: the one was in the tribe of Juda, the other in the tribe of Benjamin. After it was taken and burnt by the men of Juda, it was quickly rebuilt again by the Jebusites, as we may gather from ver. 21; and continued in their possession till it was taken by king David.

             And Caleb said: He that shall take Cariath-Sepher, and lay it waste, to him will I give my daughter Axa to wife.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=1&amp;l=13-#x">
              [13]

             And Othoniel the son of Cenez, the younger brother of Caleb, having taken it, he gave him Axa his daughter to wife.

             And as she was going on her way her husband admonished her to ask a field of her father. And as she sighed sitting on her ass, Caleb said to her: What aileth thee?
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=1&amp;l=15-#x">
              [15]

             But she answered: Give me a blessing, for thou hast given me a dry land: give me also a watery land. So Caleb gave her the upper and the nether watery ground.

             : These were three of the principal cities of the Philistines, famous both in sacred and profane history. They were taken at this time by the Israelites: but as they took no care to put garrisons in them, the Philistines soon recovered them.

               Gedeon, with three hundred men, by stratagem defeateth the Madianites.

               Then Jerobaal, who is the same as Gedeon, rising up early and all the people with him, came to the fountain that is called Harad. Now the camp of Madian was in the valley on the north side of the high hill.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=7&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]
               </a>
               And the Lord said to Gedeon: The people that are with thee are many, and Madian shall not be delivered into their hands:
               <u>
                lest Israel
               </u>
               should glory against me, and say: I was delivered by my own strength.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=7&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               Speak to the people, and proclaim in the hearing of all, I Whosoever is fearful and timorous, let him return. So two and twenty thousand men went away from mount Galaad and returned home, and only ten thousand remained.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=7&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               And the Lord said to Gedeon: The people are still too many, bring them to the waters, and there I will try them: and of whom I shall say to thee, This shall go with thee, let him go: whom I shall forbid to go, let him return.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=7&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               And when the people were come down to the waters, the Lord said to Gedeon: They that shall lap the water with their tongues, as dogs are wont to lap, thou shalt set apart by themselves: but they that shall drink bowing down their knees, shall be on the other side.

               : By this we see that God will not choose for his instruments in great achievements, which depend purely on his grace, such as, through pride and self conceit, will take the glory to themselves.

               And the number of them that had lapped water, casting it with the hand to their mouth, was three hundred men: and all the rest of the multitude had drunk kneeling.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=7&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               And the Lord said to Gedeon: By the three hundred men,

                that lapped water
               </u>
               , I will save you, and deliver Madian into thy hand: but let all the rest of the people return to their place.

                [8]
               </a>
               So taking victuals and trumpets according to their number, he ordered all the rest of the multitude to depart to their tents: and he with the three hundred gave himself to the battle. Now the camp of Madian was beneath him in the valley.

               The same night the Lord said to him: Arise, and go down into the camp: because I have delivered them into thy hand.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=7&amp;l=10-#x">

               But if thou be afraid to go alone, let Phara thy servant go down with thee.

               </u>
               : These were preferred that took the water up in their hands, and so lapped it, before them who laid themselves quite down to the waters to drink: which argued a more eager and sensual disposition.

               </a>
               And when thou shalt hear what they are saying, then shall thy hands be strengthened, and thou shalt go down more secure to the enemies' camp. And he went down with Phara his servant into part of the camp, where was the watch of men in arms.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=7&amp;l=12-#x">

               But Madian and Amalec, and all the eastern people lay scattered in the valley, as a multitude of locusts: their camels also were innumerable as the sand that lieth on the sea shore.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=7&amp;l=13-#x">

               And when Gedeon was come, one told his neighbour
               <u>
                a dream
               </u>
               : and in this manner related what he had seen: I dreamt a dream, and it seemed to me as if a hearth cake of barley bread rolled and came down into the camp of Madian: and when it was come to a tent it struck it, and beat it down flat to the ground.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=7&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               He to whom he spoke, answered: This is nothing else but the sword of Gedeon the son of Joas a man of Israel. For the Lord hath delivered Madian, and all their camp into his hand.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=7&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               And when Gedeon had heard the dream, and the interpretation thereof, he adored: and returned to the camp of Israel, and said: Arise, for the Lord hath delivered the camp of Madian into our hands.

               : Observation of dreams is commonly superstitious, and as such is condemned in the word of God: but in some extraordinary cases, as we here see, God is pleased by dreams to foretell what he is about to do.

               And he said to them: What you shall see me do, do you the same: I will go into one part of the camp, and do you as I shall do.

               And Gedeon, and the three hundred men that were with him, went into part of the camp, at the beginning of the midnight watch, and the watchmen being alarmed, they began to sound

               , and to clap the pitchers one against another.

               And when they sounded their trumpets in three places round about the camp, and had broken their pitchers, they held their lamps in their left hands, and with their right hands the trumpets which they blew, and they cried out: The sword of the Lord and of Gedeon;

               : In a mystical sense, the preachers of the gospel, in order to spiritual conquests, must not only sound with the trumpet of the word of God, but must also break their earthen pitchers, by the mortification of the flesh and its passions, and carry lamps in their hands by the light of their virtues.

               And Gedeon sent messengers into all mount Ephraim, saying: Come down to meet Madian, and take the waters before them to Bethbera and the Jordan. And all Ephraim shouted, and took the waters before them and the Jordan as far as Bethbera.

               Jephte is made ruler of the people of Galaad: he first pleads their cause against the Ammonites; then making a vow obtains a signal victory; he performs his vow.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=11&amp;l=1-#x">
                [1]
               </a>
               There was at that time Jephte the Galaadite, a most valiant man and a warrior, the son of a woman that was a harlot, and his father was Galaad.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=11&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]
               </a>
               Now Galaad had a wife of whom he had sons: who after they were grown up, thrust out Jephte, saying: Thou canst not inherit in the house of our father, because thou art born of another mother.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=11&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               Then he fled and avoided them and dwelt in the land of Tob: and there were gathered to him needy men, and robbers, and they followed him as their prince.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=11&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               In those days the children of Ammon made war against Israel.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=11&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               And as they pressed hard upon them, the ancients of Galaad went to fetch Jephte out of the land of Tob to help them:
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=11&amp;l=6-#x">
                [6]
               </a>
               And they said to him: Come thou and be our prince, and fight against the children of Ammon.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=11&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               And he answered them: Are not you the men that hated me, and cast me out of my father's house, and now you are come to me constrained by necessity?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=11&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]
               </a>
               And the princes of Galaad said to Jephte: For this cause we are now come to thee, that thou mayst go with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be head over all the inhabitants of Galaad.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=11&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               Jephte also said to them: If you be come to me sincerely, that I should fight for you against the children of Ammon, and the Lord shall deliver them into my band, shall I be your prince?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=11&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]
               </a>
               They answered him: The Lord who heareth these things, he himself is mediator and witness that we will do as we have promised.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=11&amp;l=11-#x">
                [11]
               </a>
               Jephte therefore went with the princes of Galaad, and all the people made him their prince. And Jephte spoke all his words before the Lord in Maspha.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=11&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               And he sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, to say in his name, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come against me, to waste my land?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=11&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               And he answered them: I Because Israel took away my land when he came up out of Egypt, from the confines of the Arnon unto the Jaboc and the Jordan: now therefore restore the same peaceably to me.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=11&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               And Jephte again sent word by them, and commanded them to say to the king of Ammon:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=11&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               Thus saith Jephte: Israel did not take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=11&amp;l=16-#x">
                [16]
               </a>
               But when they came up out of Egypt, he walked through the desert to the Red Sea and came into Cades.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=11&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               And he sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying: Suffer me to pass through thy land. But he would not condescend to his request. He sent also to the king of Moab, who likewise refused to give him passage. He abode therefore in Cades,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=11&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               And went round the land of Edom at the side, and the land of Moab: and came over against the east coast of the land of Moab, and camped on the other side of the Arnon: and he would not enter the bounds of Moab.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=11&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               So Israel sent messengers to Sehon king of the Amorrhites, who dwelt in Hesebon, and they said to him: Suffer me to pass through thy land to the river.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=11&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]
               </a>
               But he also despising the words of Israel, suffered him not to pass through his borders: but gathering an infinite multitude, went out against him to Jasa, and made strong opposition.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=11&amp;l=21-#x">
                [21]
               </a>
               And the Lord delivered him with all his army into the hands of Israel, and he slew him, and possessed all the land of the Amorrhite the inhabitant of that country,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=11&amp;l=22-#x">
                [22]
               </a>
               And all the coasts thereof from the Arnon to the Jaboc, and from the wilderness to the Jordan.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=7&amp;ch=11&amp;l=23-#x">
                [23]

               : Some are of opinion, that the meaning of this vow of Jephte, was to consecrate to God whatsoever should first meet him, according to the condition of the thing; so as to offer it up as a holocaust, if it were such a thing as might be offered by the law; or to devote it otherwise to God, if it were not such as the law allowed to be offered in sacrifice. And therefore they think the daughter of Jephte was not slain by her father, but only consecrated to perpetual virginity. But the common opinion followed by the generality of the holy fathers and divines is, that she was offered as a holocaust, in consequence of her father's vow: and that Jephte did not sin, at least not mortally, neither in making, nor in keeping, his vow: since he is no ways blamed for it in scripture; and was even inspired by God himself to make the vow (as appears from ver. 29, 30) in consequence of which he obtained the victory; and therefore he reasonably concluded that God, who is the master of life and death, was pleased on this occasion to dispense with his own law; and that it was the divine will he should fulfil his vow.

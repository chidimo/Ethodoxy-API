               Absalom is defeated, and slain by Joab. David mourneth for him.

                [1]
               </a>
               And David having reviewed his people, appointed over them captains of thousands and of hundreds,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=18&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]
               </a>
               And sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand of Abisai the son of Sarvia Joab's brother, and a third part under the hand of Ethai, who was of Geth: and the king said to the people: I also will go forth with you.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=18&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               And the people answered: Thou shalt not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not much mind us: or if half of us should fall, they will not greatly care: for thou alone art accounted for ten thousand: it is better therefore that thou shouldst be in the city to succour us.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=18&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               And the king said to them: What seemeth good to you, that will I do. And the king stood by the gate: and all the people went forth by their troops, by hundreds and by thousands.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=18&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               And the king commanded Joab, and Abisai, and Ethai, saying: Save me the boy Absalom. And all the people heard the king giving charge to all the princes concerning Absalom.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=18&amp;l=6-#x">
                [6]
               </a>
               So the people went out into the field against Israel and the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=18&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               And the people of Israel were defeated there by David's army, and a great slaughter was made that day of twenty thousand men.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=18&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]
               </a>
               And the battle there was scattered over the face of all the country, and there were many more of the people whom the forest
               <u>
                consumed
               </u>
               , than whom the sword devoured that day.

                [9]
               </a>
               And it happened that Absalom met the servants of David, riding on a mule: and as the mule went under a thick and large oak, his head stuck in the oak: and while he hung between the heaven and the earth, the mule on which he rode passed on.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=18&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]
               </a>
               And one saw this and told Joab, saying: I saw Absalom hanging upon an oak.
              </p>

              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=18&amp;l=11-#x">
                [11]
               </a>
               And Joab said to the man that told him: If thou sawest him, why didst thou not stab him to the ground, and I would have given thee ten sicles of silver, and belt?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=18&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               And he said to Joab: If thou wouldst have paid down in my hands a thousand pieces of silver, I would not lay my hands upon the king's son: for in our hearing he king charged thee, and Abisai, and Ethai, saying: Save me the boy Absalom.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=18&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               Yea and if I should have acted boldly against my own life, this could not have been hid from the king, and wouldst thou have stood by me?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=18&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               And Joab said: Not as thou wilt, but will set upon him in thy sight. So he took three lances in his hand, and thrust them into the heart of Absalom: and whilst he yet panted for life, sticking on the oak,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=18&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               Ten young men, armourbearers of Joab, ran up, and striking him slew him.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=18&amp;l=16-#x">
                [16]
               </a>
               And Joab sounded the trumpet, and kept back the people from pursuing after Israel in their flight, being willing to spare the multitude.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=18&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               And they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the forest, and they laid an exceeding great heap of stories upon him: but all Israel fled to their own dwellings.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=18&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               Now Absalom had reared up for himself, in his lifetime, a pillar, which is in the king's valley: for he said: I have
               <u>
                no son

               And Achimaas the son of Sadoc said: I will run and tell the king, that the Lord hath done judgment for him from the hand of his enemies.

               And Joab said to him: Thou shalt not be the messenger this day, but shalt bear tidings another day: this day I will not have thee bear tidings, because the king's son is dead.

               And Joab said to Chusai: Go, and tell the king what thou hast seen. Chusai bowed down to Joab, and ran.

               Then Achimaas the son of Sadoc said to Joab again: Why might not I also run after Chusai? And Joab said to him: Why wilt thou run, my son? thou wilt not be the bearer of good tidings.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=18&amp;l=23-#x">

               He answered: But what if I run? And he said to him: Run. Then Achimaas running by a nearer way passed Chusai.

               And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman that was on the top of the gate upon the wall, lifting up his eyes, saw a man running alone.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=18&amp;l=25-#x">

               And crying out he told the king: and the king said: If he be alone, there are good tidings in his mouth. And as he was coming apace, and drawing nearer,
              </p>
              <p>

               The watchman saw another man running, and crying aloud from above, he said: I see another man running alone. And the king said: He also is a good messenger.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=18&amp;l=27-#x">
                [27]
               </a>
               And the watchman said: The running of the foremost seemeth to me like the running of Achimaas the son of Sadoc. And the king said: He is a good man: and cometh with good news.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=18&amp;l=28-#x">
                [28]
               </a>
               And Achimaas crying out, said to the king: God save thee, O king. And falling down before the king with his face to the ground, he said: Blessed be the Lord thy God, who hath shut up the men that have lifted up their hands against the lord my king.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=18&amp;l=29-#x">

               </a>
               And the king said: Is the young man Absalom safe? And Achimaas said: I saw a great tumult, O king, when thy servant Joab sent me thy servant: I know nothing else.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=18&amp;l=30-#x">

               And the king said to him: Pass, and stand here.
              </p>

                [31]
               </a>
               And when he bad passed, and stood still, Chusai appeared: and coming up he said: I bring good tidings, my lord, the king, for the Lord hath judged for thee this day from the hand of all that have risen up against thee.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=18&amp;l=32-#x">
                [32]
               </a>
               And the king said to Chusai: Is the young man Absalom safe? And Chusai answering him, said: Let the enemies of my lord, the king, and all that rise against him unto evil, be as the young man is.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=18&amp;l=33-#x">

               The king therefore being much moved, went up to the high chamber over the gate, and wept. And as he went he spoke in this manner: My son Absalom, Absalom my son:
               <u>
                would to God
               </u>
               that I might die for thee, Absalom my son, my son Absalom.

               : David lamented the death of Absalom, because of the wretched state in which he died: and therefore would have been glad to have saved his life, even by dying for him. In which he was a figure of Christ weeping, praying and dying for his rebellious children, and even for them that crucified him.

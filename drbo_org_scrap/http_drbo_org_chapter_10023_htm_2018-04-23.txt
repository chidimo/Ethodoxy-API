               Moreover also before this the three who were princes among the thirty, went down and came to David in the harvest time into the cave of Odollam: and the camp of the Philistines was in the valley of the giants.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=23&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               And David was then in a hold. and there was a garrison of the Philistines then in Bethlehem.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=23&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               And David longed, and said: O that some man would get me a drink of the water out of the cistern, that is in Bethlehem, by the gate.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=23&amp;l=16-#x">
                [16]
               </a>
               And the three valiant men broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the cistern of Bethlehem, that was by the gate, and brought it to David: but he would not drink, but offered it to the Lord,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=23&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               Saying: The Lord be merciful to me, that I may not do this: shall I drink the blood of these men that went, and the peril of their lives? therefore he would not drink. These things did these three mighty men.

               Abisai also the brother of Joab, the son of Sarvia, was chief among three: and he lifted up his spear against three hundred whom he slew, and he was renowned among the three,

               And Banaias the son of Joiada a most valiant man, of great deeds, of Cabseel: he slew the two lions of Moab, and he went down, and slew a lion in the midst of a pit, in the time of snow.

               He also slew an Egyptian, a man worthy to be a sight, having a spear in his hand: but he went down to him with a rod, and forced the spear out of the hand of the Egyptian, and slew him with his own spear.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=10&amp;ch=23&amp;l=22-#x">

               And he was renowned among the three valiant men, who were the most honourable among the thirty: but he attained riot to the first three: and David made him of his privy council.

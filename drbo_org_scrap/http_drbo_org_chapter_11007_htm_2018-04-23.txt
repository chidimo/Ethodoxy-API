               Solomon's palace, his house in the forest, and the queen's house: the work of the two pillars: the sea (or laver) and other vessels.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=7&amp;l=1-#x">
                [1]
               </a>
               And Solomon built his own house in thirteen years, and brought it to perfection.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=7&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]
               </a>
               He built also the house of the forest of Libanus, the length of it was a hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty cubits, and the height thirty cubits: and four galleries between pillars of cedar: for he had cut cedar trees into pillars.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=7&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               And he covered the whole vault with boards of cedar, and it was held up with five and forty pillars. And one row had fifteen pillars,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=7&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               Set one against another,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=7&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               And looking one upon another, with equal space between the pillars, and over the pillars were square beams in all things equal.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=7&amp;l=6-#x">
                [6]
               </a>
               And he made a porch of pillars of fifty cubits in length, and thirty cubits in breadth: and another porch before the greater porch: and pillars, and chapiters upon the pillars.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=7&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               He made also the porch of the throne, wherein is the seat of judgment: and covered it with cedar wood from the floor to the top.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=7&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]
               </a>
               And in the midst of the porch, was a small house where he sat in judgment, of the like work. He made also a house for the daughter of Pharao (whom Solomon had taken to wife) of the same work, as this porch,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=7&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               All of costly stones, which were sawed by a certain rule and measure both within and without: from the foundation to the top of the walls, and without unto the great court.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=7&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]
               </a>
               And the foundations were of costly stones, great stones of ten cubits or eight cubits:
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=7&amp;l=11-#x">
                [11]
               </a>
               And above there were costly stones, or equal measure, hewed; and, in like manner, planks of cedar:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=7&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               And the greater court was made round with three rows of hewed stones, and one row of planks of cedar, moreover also in the inner court of the house of the Lord, and in the porch of the house.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=7&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               And king Solomon sent, and brought Hiram from Tyre,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=7&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               The son of a widow woman of the tribe of Nephtali, whose father was a Tyrian, an artificer in brass, and full of wisdom, and understanding, and skill to work all work in brass. And when he was come to king Solomon, he wrought all his work.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=7&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               And he cast two pillars in brass, each pillar was eighteen cubits high: and a line of twelve cubits compassed both the pillars.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=7&amp;l=16-#x">
                [16]
               </a>
               He made also two chapiters of molten brass, to be set upon the tops of the pillars: the height of one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=7&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               And a kind of network, and chain work wreathed together with wonderful art. Both the chapiters of the pillars were cast: seven rows of nets were on one chapiter, and seven nets on the other chapiter.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=7&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               And he made the pillars, and two rows round about each network to cover the chapiters, that were upon the top, with pomegranates: and in like manner did he to the other chapiter.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=7&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars, were of lily work in the porch, of four cubits.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=7&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]
               </a>
               And again other chapiters in the top of the pillars above, according to the measure of the pillar over against the network: and of pomegranates there were two hundred in rows round about the other chapiter.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=7&amp;l=21-#x">
                [21]
               </a>
               And he set up the two pillars in the porch of the temple: and when he had set up the pillar on the right hand, he called the name thereof
               <u>
                Jachin
               </u>
               : in like manner he set up the second pillar, and called the name thereof
               <u>
                Booz
               </u>
               .

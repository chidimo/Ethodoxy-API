               Achab believing his false prophets, rather than Micheas, is slain in Ramoth Galaad. Ochozias succeedeth him. Good king Josaphat dieth, and his son Joram succeedeth him.

               And there passed three years without war between Syria and Israel.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=22&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]
               </a>
               And in the third year, Josaphat king of Juda came down to the king of Israel.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=22&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               (And the king of Israel said to his servants: Know ye not-that Ramoth Galaad is ours, and we neglect to take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?)
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=22&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               And he said to Josaphat: Wilt thou come with me to battle to Ramoth Galaad?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=22&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               And Josaphat said to the king of Israel: As I am, so art thou: my people and thy people are one: and my horsemen, thy horsemen. And Josaphat said to the king of Israel: Inquire, I beseech thee, this day, the word of the Lord.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=22&amp;l=6-#x">
                [6]
               </a>
               Then the king of Israel assembled the prophets, about four hundred men, and he said to them: Shall I go to Ramoth Galaad to fight, or shall I forbear? They answered: Go up, and the Lord will deliver it into the hand of the king.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=22&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               And Josaphat said: Is there not here some prophet of the Lord, that we may inquire by him?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=22&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]
               </a>
               And the king of Israel said to Josaphat: There is one man left, by whom we may inquire of the Lord: Micheas the son of Jemla; but I hate him, for he doth not prophesy good to me, but evil. And Josaphat said: Speak not so, O king.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=22&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               Then the king of Israel called an eunuch, and said to him: Make haste, and bring hither Micheas the son of Jemla.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=22&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]
               </a>
               Then the king of Israel, and Josaphat king of Juda, sat each on his throne clothed with royal robes, in a court by the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets prophesied before them.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=22&amp;l=11-#x">
                [11]
               </a>
               And Sedecias the son of Chanaana made himself horns of iron, and said: Thus saith the Lord: With these shalt thou push Syria, till thou destroy it.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=22&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               And all the prophets prophesied in like manner, saying: Go up to Ramoth Galaad, and prosper, for the Lord will deliver it into the king's hands.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=22&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               And the messenger, that went to call Micheas, spoke to him, saying: Behold the words of the prophets with one mouth declare good things to the king: let thy word therefore be like to theirs, and speak that which is good.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=22&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               But Micheas said to him: As the Lord liveth, whatsoever the Lord shall say to me, that will I speak.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=22&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               So he came to the king, and the king said to him: Micheas, shall we go to Ramoth Galaad to battle, or shall we forbear? He answered him:
               <u>
                Go up
               </u>
               , and prosper, and the Lord shall deliver it into the king's hands.
              </p>
              <p class="note">
               [15]
               <u>
                "Go up"
               </u>
               : This was spoken ironically, and by way of jesting at the flattering speeches of the false prophets: and so the king understood it, as appears by his adjuring Micheas, in the following verse, to tell him the truth in the name of the Lord.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=22&amp;l=16-#x">
                [16]
               </a>
               But the king said to him: I adjure thee again and again, that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the Lord.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=22&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               And he said: I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, like sheep that have no shepherd: and the Lord said: These have no master: let every man of them return to his house in peace.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=22&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               (Then the king of Israel said to Josaphat: Did I not tell thee, that he prophesieth no good to me, but always evil?)
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=22&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               And he added and said: Hear thou therefore the word of the Lord: I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the army of heaven standing by him on the right hand and on the left:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=11&amp;ch=22&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]
               </a>
               And
               <u>
                the Lord said
               </u>

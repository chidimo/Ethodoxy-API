               David's sin in numbering the people is punished by a pestilence: which ceaseth upon his offering sacrifice in the thrashingfloor of Ornan.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=1-#x">
                [1]
               </a>
               And Satan rose up against Israel: and moved David to number Israel.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]
               </a>
               And David said to Joab, and to the rulers of the people: Go, and number Israel from Bersabee even to Dan, and bring me the number of them that I may know it.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               And Joab answered: The Lord make his people a hundred times more than they are: but, my lord the king, are they not all thy servants: why doth my lord seek this thing, which may be imputed as a sin to Israel?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               But the king's word rather prevailed: and Joab departed, and went through all Israel: and returned to Jerusalem.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               And he gave David
               <u>
                the number
               </u>
               of them, whom he had surveyed: and all the number of Israel was found to be eleven hundred thousand men that drew the sword: and of Juda four hundred and seventy thousand fighting men.

              <p class="note">
               [5]

                "The number"
               </u>
               : The difference of the numbers here and 2 Kings 24. is to be accounted for, by supposing the greater number to be that which was really found, and the lesser to be that which Joab gave in.
              </p>

               </a>
               But Levi and Benjamin he did not number: for Joab unwillingly executed the king's orders.

                [7]
               </a>
               And God was displeased with this thing that was commanded: and he struck Israel.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]
               </a>
               And David said to God: I have sinned exceedingly in doing this: I beseech thee take away the iniquity of thy servant, for I have done foolishly.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               And the Lord spoke to Gad the seer of David, saying:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]
               </a>
               Go, and speak to David, and tell him: Thus saith the Lord: I give thee the choice of three things: choose one which thou wilt, and I will do it to thee.

              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=11-#x">
                [11]
               </a>
               And when Gad was come to David, he said to him: Thus saith the Lord: choose which thou wilt:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]

               Either
               <u>
                three years' famine
               </u>
               : or three months to flee from thy enemies, and not to be able to escape their sword: or three days to have the sword of the Lord, and pestilence in the land, and the angel of the Lord destroying in all the coasts of Israel: now therefore see what I shall answer him who sent me.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               And David said to Gad: I am on every side in a great strait: but it is better for me to fall into the hands of the Lord, for his mercies are many, than into the hands of men.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               So the Lord sent a pestilence upon Israel. And there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               And he sent an angel to Jerusalem, to strike it: and as he was striking it, the Lord beheld, and took pity for the greatness of the evil: and said to the angel that destroyed: It is enough, now stop thy hand. And the angel of the Lord stood by the thrashing floor of
               <u>

               And David lifting up his eyes, saw the angel of the Lord standing between heaven and earth, with a drawn sword in his hand, turned against Jerusalem: and both he and the ancients clothed in haircloth, fell down flat on the ground.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               And David said to God: Am not I he that commanded the people to be numbered? It is I that have sinned: it is I that have done the evil: but as for this flock, what hath it deserved? O Lord my God, let thy hand be turned, I beseech thee, upon me, and upon my father's house: and let not thy people be destroyed.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               And the angel of the Lord commanded Gad to tell David, to go up, and build an altar to the Lord God in the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               And David went up, according to the word of Gad, which he spoke to him in the name of the Lord.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]
               </a>
               Now when Ornan looked up, and saw the angel, he and his four sons hid themselves: for at that time he was thrashing wheat in the floor.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=21-#x">
                [21]
               </a>
               And as David was coming to Ornan, Ornan saw him, and went out of the threshingfloor to meet him, and bowed down to him with his face to the ground.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=22-#x">
                [22]
               </a>
               And David said to him: Give me this place of thy threshingfloor, that I may build therein an altar to the Lord: but thou shalt take of me as much money as it is worth, that the plague may cease from the people.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=23-#x">
                [23]
               </a>
               And Ornan said to David: Take it, and let my lord the king do all that pleaseth him: and moreover the oxen also I give for a holocaust, and the drays for wood, and the wheat for the sacrifice: I will give it all willingly.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=24-#x">
                [24]
               </a>
               And king David said to him: It shall not be so, but I will give thee money as much as it is worth: for I must not take it from thee, and so offer to the Lord holocausts free cost.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=25-#x">
                [25]
               </a>
               So David gave to Ornan for the place,
               <u>
                six hundred sicles
               </u>

               </a>
               And he built there an altar to the Lord: and he offered holocausts, and peace offerings, and he called upon the Lord, and he heard him by sending fire from heaven upon the altar of the holocaust.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=27-#x">
                [27]
               </a>
               And the Lord commanded the angel: and he put up his sword again into the sheath.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=28-#x">
                [28]
               </a>
               And David seeing that the Lord had heard him in the threshingfloor of Oman the Jebusite, forthwith offered victims there.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=29-#x">
                [29]

               But the tabernacle of the Lord, which Moses made in the desert, and the altar of holocausts, was at that time in the high place of Gabaon.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=13&amp;ch=21&amp;l=30-#x">
                [30]
               </a>
               And David could not go to the altar there to pray to God: for he was seized with an exceeding great fear, seeing the sword of the angel of the Lord.

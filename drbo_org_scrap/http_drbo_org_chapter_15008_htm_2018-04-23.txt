               And I weighed to their hands six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and a hundred vessels of silver, and a hundred talents of gold,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=15&amp;ch=8&amp;l=27-#x">
                [27]
               </a>
               And twenty cups of gold, of a thousand solids, and two vessels of the best shining brass, beautiful as gold.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=15&amp;ch=8&amp;l=28-#x">
                [28]
               </a>
               And I said to them: You are the holy ones of the Lord, and the vessels are holy, and the silver and gold, that is freely offered to the Lord the God of our fathers.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=15&amp;ch=8&amp;l=29-#x">
                [29]
               </a>
               Watch ye and keep them, till you deliver them by weight before the chief of the priests, and of the Levites, and the heads of the families of Israel in Jerusalem, into the treasure of the house of the Lord.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=15&amp;ch=8&amp;l=30-#x">
                [30]
               </a>
               And the priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and gold, and the vessels, to carry them to Jerusalem to the house of our God.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=15&amp;ch=8&amp;l=31-#x">
                [31]
               </a>
               Then we set forward from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month to go to Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, and delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and of such as lay in wait by the way.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=15&amp;ch=8&amp;l=32-#x">
                [32]
               </a>
               And we came to Jerusalem, and we stayed there three days.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=15&amp;ch=8&amp;l=33-#x">
                [33]
               </a>
               And on the fourth day the silver and the gold, and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Urias the priest, and with him was Eleazar the son of Phinees, and with them Jozabad the son of Josue, and Noadaia the son of Benoi, Levites.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=15&amp;ch=8&amp;l=34-#x">
                [34]
               </a>
               According to the number and weight of every thing: and all the weight was written at that time.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=15&amp;ch=8&amp;l=35-#x">
                [35]
               </a>
               Moreover the children of them that had been carried away that were come out of the captivity, offered holocausts to the God of Israel, twelve calves for all the people of Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and twelve he goats for sin: all for a holocaust to the Lord.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=15&amp;ch=8&amp;l=36-#x">
                [36]
               </a>
               And they gave the king's edicts to the lords that were from the king's court, and the governors beyond the river, and they furthered the people and the house of God.

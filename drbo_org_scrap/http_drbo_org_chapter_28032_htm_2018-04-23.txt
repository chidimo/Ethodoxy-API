               The word that came to Jeremias from the Lord in the tenth year of Sedecias king of Juda: the same is eighteenth year of Nabuchodonosor.

                [3]
               </a>
               For Sedecias king of Juda had shut him up, saying: Why dost thou prophesy, saying: Thus saith the Lord: Behold I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=28&amp;ch=32&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]

               And Sedecias king of Juda shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans: but he shall be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon: and he shall speak to him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall see his eyes.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=28&amp;ch=32&amp;l=5-#x">

               And he shall lead Sedecias to Babylon: and he shall be there till I visit him, saith the Lord. But if you will fight against the Chaldeans, you shall have no success.

                [6]
               </a>
               And Jeremias said: The word of the Lord came to me, saying:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=28&amp;ch=32&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]

               Behold, Hanameel the son of Sellum thy cousin shall come to thee, saying: Buy thee my field, which is in Anathoth, for it is thy right to buy it, being akin.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=28&amp;ch=32&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]
               </a>
               And Hanameel my uncle's son cam to me, according to the word of the to the entry of the prison, and said me: Buy my field, which is in in the land of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is thins, and thou art next of kin to possess it. And I understood this was the word of the Lord.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=28&amp;ch=32&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               And I bought the held of my uncle's son, that is in Anathoth: and I weighed him the money, seven staters, and ten pieces of silver.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=28&amp;ch=32&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]
               </a>
               And I wrote it in a book and sealed it, and took witnesses: and I weighed him the money in the balances.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=28&amp;ch=32&amp;l=11-#x">
                [11]
               </a>
               And I took the deed of the purchase that was sealed, and the stipulations, and the ratifications with the seals that were on the outside.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=28&amp;ch=32&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               And I gave the deed of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neri the son of Maasias in the sight of Hanameel my uncle's son, in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, and before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=28&amp;ch=32&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               And I charged Baruch before them, saying:

                [14]

               Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Take these writings, this deed of the purchase that is sealed up, and this deed that is open: and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=28&amp;ch=32&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]

               For thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Houses, and fields, and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land.

               </a>
               And after I had delivered the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neri, I prayed to the Lord, saying:

               Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God, behold thou hast made heaven and earth by thy great power, and thy stretched out arm: no word shall be hard to thee:

                [18]

               Thou shewest mercy unto thousands, and returnest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: O most mighty, great, and powerful, the Lord of hosts is thy name.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=28&amp;ch=32&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]

               Great in counsel and incomprehensible in thought: whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the children of Adam, to render unto every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his devices.

               And hast brought forth thy people Israel, out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and a stretched out arm, and with great terror.

               And they have set their idols in the house, in which my name is called upon, to defile it.

               The Assyrian empire fell for their pride: the Egyptian shall fall in like manner.

                [1]
               </a>
               And it came to pass in the eleventh year, the third month, the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=31&amp;ch=31&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]
               </a>
               Son of man, speak to Pharao king of Egypt, and to his people: To whom art thou like in thy greatness?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=31&amp;ch=31&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               Behold, the Assyrian was like a cedar in Libanus, with fair branches, and full of leaves, of a high stature, and his top was elevated among the thick boughs.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=31&amp;ch=31&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               The waters nourished him, the deep set him up on high, the streams thereof ran round about his roots, and it sent forth its rivulets to all the trees of the country.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=31&amp;ch=31&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               Therefore was his height exalted above all the trees of the country: and his branches were multiplied, and his boughs were elevated because of many waters.

               And when he had spread forth his shadow, all the fowls of the air made their nests in his boughs, and all the beasts of the forest brought forth their young under his branches, and the assembly of many nations dwelt under his shadow.

               And he was most beautiful for his greatness, and for the spreading of his branches: for his root was near great waters.

               The cedars in the paradise of God were not higher than he, the fir trees did not equal his top, neither were the plane trees to be compared with him for branches: no tree in the paradise of God was like him in his beauty.

               Thus saith the Lord God: In the day when he went down to hell, I brought in mourning, I covered him with the deep: and I withheld its rivers, and restrained the many waters: Libanus grieved for him, and all the trees of the field trembled.

             The reign of Alexander and his successors: Antiochus rifles and profanes the temple of God: and persecutes unto death all that will not forsake the law of God, and the religion of their fathers.

             Now it came to pass, after that Alexander the son of Philip the Macedonian, who first reigned in Greece, coming out of the land of Cethim, had overthrown Darius king of the Persians and Medes:
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=1&amp;l=2-#x">
              [2]
             </a>
             He fought many battles, and took the strong holds of all, and slew the kings of the earth:
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=1&amp;l=3-#x">
              [3]
             </a>
             And he went through even to the ends of the earth, and took the spoils of many nations: and the earth was quiet before him.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=1&amp;l=4-#x">
              [4]
             </a>
             And he gathered a power, and a very strong army: and his heart was exalted and lifted up.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=1&amp;l=5-#x">
              [5]
             </a>
             And he subdued countries of nations, and princes: and they became tributaries to him.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=1&amp;l=6-#x">
              [6]
             </a>
             And after these things, he fell down upon his bed, and knew that he should die.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=1&amp;l=7-#x">
              [7]

             <u>
              divided his kingdom

             among them, while he was yet alive.

              [8]
             </a>
             And Alexander reigned twelve years, and he died.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=1&amp;l=9-#x">
              [9]
             </a>
             And his servants made themselves kings every one in his place:

              [10]
             </a>
             And they all put crowns upon themselves after his death, and their sons after them many years, and evils were multiplied in the earth.

             In those days there went out of Israel wicked men, and they persuaded many, saying: Let us go, and make a covenant with the heathens that are round about us: for since we departed from them, many evils have befallen us.

             And the kingdom was established before Antiochus, and he had a mind to reign over the land of Egypt, that he might reign over two kingdoms.

              [18]

             And after Antiochus had ravaged Egypt in the hundred and forty-third year, he returned and went up against Israel.

             And he proudly entered into the sanctuary, and took away the golden altar, and the candlestick of light, and all the vessels thereof, and the table of proposition, and the pouring vessels, and the vials, and the little mortars of gold, and the veil, and the crowns, and the golden ornament that was before the temple: and he broke them all in pieces.

             And he took the silver and gold, and the precious vessels: and he took the hidden treasures which he found: and when he had taken all away he departed into his own country.

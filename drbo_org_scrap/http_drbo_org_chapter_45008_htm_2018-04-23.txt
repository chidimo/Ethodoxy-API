               Judas Machabeus, and his brethren, and the people of the Jews have sent us to you, to make alliance and peace with you, and that we may be registered your confederates and friends.

               : So Judas had heard: and it was so far true, with regard to the ancient Romans, that as yet no envy or jealousy had divided them into such open factions and civil wars, as they afterwards experienced in the time of Marius and Sylla, etc.

               And the proposal was pleasing in their sight.

               And this is the copy of the writing that they wrote back again, graven in tables of brass, and sent to Jerusalem, that it might be with them there for a memorial of the peace and alliance.

               GOOD SUCCESS BE TO THE ROMANS, and to the people of the Jews, by sea and by land for ever: and far be the sword and enemy from them.

               But if there come first any war upon the Romans, or any of their confederates, in all their dominions:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=8&amp;l=25-#x">
                [25]

               The nation of the Jews shall help them according as the time shall direct, with all their heart:

              <p>

               </a>
               Neither shall they give them, whilst they are fighting, or furnish them with wheat, or arms, or money, or ships, as it hath seemed good to the Romans: and they shall obey their orders, without taking any thing of them.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=8&amp;l=27-#x">
                [27]
               </a>
               In like manner also if war shall come first upon the nation of the Jews, the Romans shall help them with all their heart, according as the time shall permit them.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=8&amp;l=28-#x">
                [28]
               </a>
               And there shall not be given to them that come to their aid, either wheat, or arms, or money, or ships, as it hath seemed good to the Romans: and they shall observe their orders without deceit.

               According to these articles did the Romans covenant with the people of the Jews.

               And if after this one party or the other shall have a mind to add to these articles, or take away anything, they may do it at their pleasure: and whatsoever they shall add, or take away, shall be ratified.

               Moreover concerning the evils that Demetrius the king hath done against them, we have written to him, saying: Why hast thou made thy yoke heavy upon our friends, and allies, the Jews?

               If therefore they come again to us complaining of thee, we will do them justice, and will make war against thee by sea and land.

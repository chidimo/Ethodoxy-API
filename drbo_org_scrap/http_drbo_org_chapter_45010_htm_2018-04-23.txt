               Alexander Bales sets himself up for king: both he and Demetrius seek to make Jonathan their friend. Alexander kills Demetrius in battle, and honours Jonathan. His victory over Apollonius.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=1-#x">
                [1]
               </a>
               Now in the hundred and sixtieth year Alexander the son of Antiochus, surnamed the Illustrious, came up and took Ptolemais, and they received him, and he reigned there.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]
               </a>
               And king Demetrius heard of it, and gathered together an exceeding great army, and went forth against him to fight.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               And Demetrius sent a letter to Jonathan with peaceable words, to magnify him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               For he said: Let us first make a peace with him, before he make one with Alexander against us.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               For he will remember all the evils that we have done against him, and against his brother, and against his nation.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=6-#x">
                [6]
               </a>
               And he gave him authority to gather together an army, and to make arms, and that he should be his confederate: and the hostages that were in the castle, he commanded to be delivered to him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               And Jonathan came to Jerusalem, and read the letters in the hearing of all the people, and of them that were in the castle.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]
               </a>
               And they were struck with great fear, because they heard that the king had given him authority to gather together an army.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               And the hostages were delivered to Jonathan, and he restored them to their parents.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]
               </a>
               And Jonathan dwelt in Jerusalem, and began to build, and to repair the city.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=11-#x">
                [11]
               </a>
               And he ordered workmen to build the walls, and mount Sion round about with square stones for fortification: and so they did.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               And the strangers that were in the strong holds, which Bacchides had built, fled away.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               And every man left his place, and departed into his own country:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               Only in Bethsura there remained some of them, that had forsaken the law, and the commandments of God: for this was a place of refuge for them.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               And king Alexander heard of the promises that Demetrius had made Jonathan: and they told him of the battles, and the worthy acts that he, and his brethren had done, and the labours that they had endured.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=16-#x">
                [16]
               </a>
               And he said: Shall we find such another man? now therefore we will make him our friend and our confederate.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               So he wrote a letter, and sent it to him according to these words, saying:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               King Alexander to his brother Jonathan, greeting.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               We have heard of thee, that thou art a man of great power, and fit to be our friend:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]
               </a>
               Now therefore we make thee this day high priest of thy nation, and that thou be called the king's friend, (and he sent him a purple robe, and a crown of gold,) and that thou be of one mind with us in our affairs, and keep friendship with us.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=21-#x">
                [21]
               </a>
               Then Jonathan put on the holy vestment in the seventh month, in the year one hundred and threescore, at the feast day of the tabernacles: and he gathered together an army, and made a great number of arms.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=22-#x">
                [22]
               </a>
               And Demetrius heard these words, and was exceeding sorry, and said:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=23-#x">
                [23]
               </a>
               What is this that we have done, that Alexander hath prevented us to gain the friendship of the Jews to strengthen himself?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=24-#x">
                [24]
               </a>
               I also will write to them words of request, and offer dignities, and gifts: that they may be with me to aid me.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=25-#x">
                [25]
               </a>
               And he wrote to them in these words: King Demetrius to the nation of the Jews, greeting.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=26-#x">
                [26]
               </a>
               Whereas you have kept covenant with us, and have continued in our friendship, and have not joined with our enemies, we have heard of it, and are glad.

               And Apollonius heard of it, and he took three thousand horsemen, and a great army.

              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=81-#x">
                [81]
               </a>
               But the people stood still, as Jonathan had commanded them: and so their horses were fatigued.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=82-#x">
                [82]
               </a>
               Then Simon drew forth his army, and attacked the legion: for the horsemen were wearied: and they were discomfited by him, and fled.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=83-#x">
                [83]
               </a>
               And they that were scattered about the plain, fled into Azotus, and went into Bethdagon their idol's temple, there to save themselves.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=84-#x">
                [84]
               </a>
               But Jonathan set fire to Azotus, and the cities that were around it, and took the spoils of them, and the temple of Dagon: and all them that were fled into it, he burnt with fire.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=85-#x">
                [85]
               </a>
               So they that were slain by the sword, with them that were burnt, were almost eight thousand men.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=86-#x">
                [86]
               </a>
               And Jonathan removed his army from thence, and camped against Ascalon: and they went out of the city to meet him with great honour.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=87-#x">
                [87]
               </a>
               And Jonathan returned into Jerusalem with his people, having many spoils.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=88-#x">
                [88]
               </a>
               And it came to pass: When Alexander the king heard these words, that he honoured Jonathan yet more.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=10&amp;l=89-#x">
                [89]
               </a>
               And he sent him a buckle of gold, as the custom is, to be given to such as are of the royal blood. And he gave him Accaron and all the borders thereof in possession.

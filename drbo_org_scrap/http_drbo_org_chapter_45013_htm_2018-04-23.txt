               Simon is made captain general in the room of his brother. Jonathan is slain by Tryphon. Simon is favoured by Demetrius: he taketh Gaza, and the castle of Jerusalem.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=1-#x">
                [1]
               </a>
               Now Simon heard that Tryphon was gathering together a very great army, to invade the land of Juda, and to destroy it.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]
               </a>
               And seeing that the people was in dread, and in fear, he went up to Jerusalem, and assembled the people:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               And exhorted them, saying: You know what great battles I and my brethren, and the house of my father, have fought for the laws, and the sanctuary, and the distresses that we have seen:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               By reason whereof all my brethren have lost their lives for Israel's sake, and I am left alone.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               And now far be it from me to spare my life in any time of trouble: for I am not better than my brethren.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=6-#x">
                [6]
               </a>
               I will avenge then my nation and the sanctuary, and our children, and wives: for all the heathens are gathered together to destroy us out of mere malice.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               And the spirit of the people was enkindled as soon as they heard these words.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]
               </a>
               And they answered with a loud voice, saying: Thou art our leader in the place of Judas, and Jonathan thy brother.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               Fight thou our battles, and we will do whatsoever thou shalt say to us.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]
               </a>
               So gathering together all the men of war, he made haste to finish all the walls of Jerusalem, and he fortified it round about.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=11-#x">
                [11]
               </a>
               And he sent Jonathan the son of Absalom, and with him a new army into Joppe, and he cast out them that were in it, and himself remained there.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               And Tryphon removed from Ptolemais with a great army, to invade the land of Juda, and Jonathan was with him in custody.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               But Simon pitched in Addus, over against the plain.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               And when Tryphon understood that Simon was risen up in the place of his brother Jonathan, and that he meant to join battle with him, he sent messengers to him,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               Saying: We have detained thy brother Jonathan for the money that he owed in the king's account, by reason of the affairs which he had the management of.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=16-#x">
                [16]
               </a>
               But now send a hundred talents of silver, and his two sons for hostages, that when he is set at liberty he may not revolt from us, and we will release him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               Now Simon knew that he spoke deceitfully to him, nevertheless he ordered the money, and the children to be sent: lest he should bring upon himself a great hatred of the people of Israel, who might have said:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               Because he sent not the money, and the children, therefore is he lost.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               So he sent the children, and the hundred talents: and he lied, and did not let Jonathan go.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]
               </a>
               And after this Tryphon entered within the country, to destroy it: and they went about by the way that leadeth to Ador: and Simon and his army marched to every place
               <u>
                whithersoever they went
               </u>
               .
              </p>
              <p class="note">
               [20]
               <u>
                "Whithersoever they went"
               </u>
               : That is, whithersoever Tryphon and his horsemen went in order to oppose them.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=21-#x">
                [21]
               </a>
               And they that were in the castle, sent messengers to Tryphon, that he should make haste to come through the desert, and send them victuals.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=22-#x">
                [22]
               </a>
               And Tryphon made ready all his horsemen to come that night: but there fell a very great snow, and he came not into the country of Galaad.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=23-#x">
                [23]
               </a>
               And when he approached to Bascama, he slew Jonathan and his sons there.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=24-#x">
                [24]
               </a>
               And Tryphon returned, and went into his own country.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=25-#x">
                [25]
               </a>
               And Simon sent, and took the bones of Jonathan his brother, and buried them in Modin, in the city of his fathers.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=26-#x">
                [26]
               </a>
               And all Israel bewailed him with great lamentation: and they mourned for him many days.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=27-#x">
                [27]
               </a>
               And Simon built over the sepulchre of his father and of his brethren, a building lofty to the sight, of polished stone behind and before:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=28-#x">
                [28]
               </a>
               And he set up seven pyramids one against another for his father and his mother, and his four brethren:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=29-#x">
                [29]
               </a>
               And round about these he set great pillars: and upon the pillars arms for a perpetual memory: and by the arms ships carved, which might be seen by all that sailed on the sea.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=30-#x">
                [30]
               </a>
               This is the sepulchre that he made in Modin even unto this day.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=31-#x">
                [31]
               </a>
               But Tryphon when he was upon a journey with the young king Antiochus, treacherously slew him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=32-#x">
                [32]
               </a>
               And he reigned in his place, and put on the crown of Asia: and brought great evils upon the land.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=33-#x">
                [33]
               </a>
               And Simon built up the strong holds of Judea, fortifying them with high towers, and great walls, and gates, and bars: and he stored up victuals in the fortresses.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=34-#x">
                [34]
               </a>
               And Simon chose men and sent to king Demetrius, to the end that he should grant an immunity to the land: for all that Tryphon did was to spoil.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=35-#x">
                [35]
               </a>
               And king Demetrius in answer to this request, wrote a letter in this manner:
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=36-#x">
                [36]
               </a>
               King Demetrius to Simon the high priest, and friend of kings, and to the ancients, and to the nation of the Jews, greeting.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=37-#x">
                [37]
               </a>
               The golden crown, and the palm, which you sent, we have received: and we are ready to make a firm peace with you, and to write to the king's chief officers to release you the things that we have released.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=38-#x">
                [38]
               </a>
               For all that we have decreed in your favour, shall stand in force. The strong holds that you have built, shall be your own.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=39-#x">
                [39]
               </a>
               And as for any oversight or fault committed unto this day, we forgive it, and the crown which you owed: and if any other thing were taxed in Jerusalem, now let it not be taxed.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=40-#x">
                [40]
               </a>
               And if any of you be fit to be enrolled among ours, let them be enrolled, and let there be peace between us.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=41-#x">
                [41]
               </a>
               In the year one hundred and seventy the yoke of the Gentiles was taken off from Israel.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=42-#x">
                [42]
               </a>
               And the people of Israel began to write in the instruments, and public records, The first year under Simon the high priest, the great captain and prince of the Jews.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=43-#x">
                [43]
               </a>
               In those days Simon besieged Gaza, and camped round about it, and he made engines, and set them to the city, and he struck one tower, and took it.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=44-#x">
                [44]
               </a>
               And they that were within the engine leaped into the city: and there was a great uproar in the city.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=45-#x">
                [45]
               </a>
               And they that were in the city went up with their wives and children upon the wall, with their garments rent, and they cried with a loud voice, beseeching Simon to grant them peace.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=46-#x">
                [46]
               </a>
               And they said: Deal not with us according to our evil deeds, but according to thy mercy.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=47-#x">
                [47]
               </a>
               And Simon being moved, did not destroy them: but yet he cast them out of the city, and cleansed the houses wherein there had been idols, and then he entered into it with hymns, blessing the Lord.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=48-#x">
                [48]
               </a>
               And having cast out of it all uncleanness, he placed in it men that should observe the law: and he fortified it, and made it his habitation.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=49-#x">
                [49]
               </a>
               But they that were in the castle of Jerusalem were hindered from going out and coming into the country, and from buying and selling: and they were straitened with hunger, and many of them perished through famine.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=50-#x">
                [50]
               </a>
               And they cried to Simon for peace, and he granted it to them: and he cast them out from thence, and cleansed the castle from uncleannesses.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=51-#x">
                [51]
               </a>
               And they entered into it the three and twentieth day of the second month, in the year one hundred and seventy-one, with thanksgiving, and branches of palm trees, and harps, and cymbals, and psalteries, and hymns, and canticles, because the great enemy was destroyed out of Israel.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=52-#x">
                [52]
               </a>
               And he ordained that these days should be kept every year with gladness.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=53-#x">
                [53]
               </a>
               And he fortified the mountain of the temple that was near the castle, and he dwelt there himself, and they that were with him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=13&amp;l=54-#x">
                [54]
               </a>
               And Simon saw that John his son was a valiant man for war: and he made him captain of all the forces: and he dwelt in Gazara.

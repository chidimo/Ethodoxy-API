               Antiochus son of Demetrius honours Simon. The Romans write to divers nations in favour of the Jews. Antiochus quarrels with Simon, and sends troops to annoy him.

               Forasmuch as certain pestilent men have usurped the kingdom of our fathers, and my purpose is to challenge the kingdom, and to restore it to its former estate: and I have chosen a great army, and have built ships of war.

               In the year one hundred and seventy-four Antiochus entered into the land of his fathers, and all the forces assembled to him, so that few were left with Tryphon.

                [13]

               And Antiochus camped above Dora with a hundred and twenty thousand men of war, and eight thousand horsemen:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=15&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               And he invested the city, and the ships drew near by sea: and they annoyed the city by land, and by sea, and suffered none to come in, or to go out.

               It hath seemed good therefore to us to write to the kings, and countries, that they should do them no harm, nor fight against them, their cities, or countries: and that they should give no aid to them that fight against them.

               And they wrote a copy thereof to Simon the high priest, and to the people of the Jews.

               But king Antiochus moved his camp to Dora the second time, assaulting it continually, and making engines: and shut up Tryphon, that he could not go out.

               And Simon sent to him two thousand chosen men to aid him, silver also, and gold, and abundance of furniture.

               And he would not receive them, but broke all the covenant that he had made with him before, and alienated himself from him.

               And he sent to him Athenobius one of his friends, to treat with him, saying: You hold Joppe, and Gazara, and the castle that is in Jerusalem, which are cities of my kingdom:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=15&amp;l=29-#x">
                [29]
               </a>
               Their borders you have wasted, and you have made great havock in the land, and have got the dominion of many places in my kingdom.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=15&amp;l=30-#x">
                [30]
               </a>
               Now therefore deliver up the cities that you have taken, and the tributes of the places whereof you have gotten the dominion without the borders of Judea.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=15&amp;l=31-#x">
                [31]
               </a>
               But if not, give me for them five hundred talents of silver, and for the havock that you have made, and the tributes of the cities other five hundred talents: or else we will come and fight against you.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=15&amp;l=32-#x">
                [32]
               </a>
               So Athenobius the king's friend came to Jerusalem, and saw the glory of Simon and his magnificence in gold, and silver, and his great equipage, and he was astonished, and told him the king's words.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=15&amp;l=33-#x">
                [33]

               And Simon answered him, and said to him: We have neither taken other men's land, neither do we hold that which is other men's: but the inheritance of our fathers, which was for some time unjustly possessed by our enemies.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=15&amp;l=34-#x">
                [34]
               </a>
               But we having opportunity claim the inheritance of our fathers.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=15&amp;l=35-#x">
                [35]
               </a>
               And as to thy complaints concerning Joppe and Gazara, they did great harm to the people, and to our country: yet for these we will give a hundred talents. And Athenobius answered him not a word:
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=15&amp;l=36-#x">
                [36]
               </a>
               But returning in a rage to the king, made report to him of these words, and of the glory of Simon, and of all that he had seen, and the king was exceeding angry.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=15&amp;l=37-#x">
                [37]
               </a>
               And Tryphon fled away by ship to Orthosias.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=15&amp;l=38-#x">
                [38]
               </a>
               And the king appointed Cendebeus captain of the sea coast, and gave him an army of footmen and horsemen.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=15&amp;l=39-#x">
                [39]
               </a>
               And he commanded him to march with his army towards Judea: and he commanded him to build up Gedor, and to fortify the gates of the city, and to war against the people. But the king himself pursued after Tryphon.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=45&amp;ch=15&amp;l=40-#x">
                [40]
               </a>
               And Cendebeus came to Jamnia, and began to provoke the people, and to ravage Judea, and to take the people prisoners, and to kill, and to build Gedor.
              </p>
              <p>

               </a>
               And he placed there horsemen, and an army: that they might issue forth, and make incursions upon the ways of Judea, as the king had commanded him.

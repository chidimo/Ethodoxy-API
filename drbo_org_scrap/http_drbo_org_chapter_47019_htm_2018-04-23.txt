               Christ declares matrimony to be indissoluble: he recommends the making one's self an eunuch for the kingdom of heaven; and parting with all things for him. He shews the danger of riches, and the reward of leaving all to follow him.

               The young man saith to him: All these I have kept from my youth, what is yet wanting to me?

               Jesus saith to him: If thou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come follow me.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=19&amp;l=22-#x">

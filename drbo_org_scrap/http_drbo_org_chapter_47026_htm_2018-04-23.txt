               And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended all these words, he said to his disciples:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=26&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]

               You know that after two days shall be the pasch, and the son of man shall be delivered up to be crucified:

                [3]

               Then were gathered together the chief priests and ancients of the people into the court of the high priest, who was called Caiphas:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=26&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               And they consulted together, that by subtilty they might apprehend Jesus, and put him to death.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=26&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               But they said: Not on the festival day, lest perhaps there should be a tumult among the people.

               And when Jesus was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=26&amp;l=7-#x">

               There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of precious ointment, and poured it on his head as he was at table.

                [8]
               </a>
               And the disciples seeing it, had indignation, saying: To what purpose is this waste?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=26&amp;l=9-#x">

               For she in pouring this ointment upon my body, hath done it for my burial.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=26&amp;l=13-#x">

               Then went one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, to the chief priests,

                [63]
               </a>
               But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said to him: I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us if thou be the Christ the Son of God.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=26&amp;l=64-#x">
                [64]
               </a>
               Jesus saith to him: Thou hast said it. Nevertheless I say to you, hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=26&amp;l=65-#x">
                [65]
               </a>
               Then the high priests rent his garments, saying: He hath blasphemed; what further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy:
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=26&amp;l=66-#x">
                [66]
               </a>
               What think you? But they answering, said: He is guilty of death.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=26&amp;l=67-#x">
                [67]
               </a>
               Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him: and others struck his face with the palms of their hands,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=26&amp;l=68-#x">
                [68]
               </a>
               Saying: Prophesy unto us, O Christ, who is he that struck thee?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=26&amp;l=69-#x">
                [69]
               </a>
               But Peter sat without in the court: and there came to him a servant maid, saying: Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilean.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=26&amp;l=70-#x">
                [70]
               </a>
               But he denied before them all, saying: I know not what thou sayest.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=26&amp;l=71-#x">
                [71]
               </a>
               And as he went out of the gate, another maid saw him, and she saith to them that were there: This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=26&amp;l=72-#x">
                [72]
               </a>
               And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=26&amp;l=73-#x">
                [73]
               </a>
               And after a little while they came that stood by, and said to Peter: Surely thou also art one of them; for even thy speech doth discover thee.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=26&amp;l=74-#x">
                [74]
               </a>
               Then he began to curse and to swear that he knew not the man. And immediately the cock crew.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=47&amp;ch=26&amp;l=75-#x">
                [75]
               </a>
               And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which he had said: Before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice. And going forth, he wept bitterly.

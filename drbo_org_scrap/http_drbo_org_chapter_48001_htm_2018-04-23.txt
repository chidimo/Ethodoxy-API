              [2]

             As it is written in Isaias the prophet: Behold I send my angel before thy face, who shall prepare the way before thee.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=3-#x">
              [3]
             </a>
             A voice of one crying in the desert: Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=4-#x">
              [4]
             </a>
             John was in the desert baptizing, and preaching the baptism of penance, unto remission of sins.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=5-#x">
              [5]
             </a>
             And there went out to him all the country of Judea, and all they of Jerusalem, and were baptized by him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=6-#x">
              [6]
             </a>
             And John was clothed with camel's hair, and a leathern girdle about his loins; and he ate locusts and wild honey.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=7-#x">
              [7]
             </a>
             And he preached, saying: There cometh after me one mightier than I, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and loose.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=8-#x">
              [8]
             </a>
             I have baptized you with water; but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=9-#x">
              [9]
             </a>
             And it came to pass, in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=10-#x">
              [10]
             </a>
             And forthwith coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens opened, and the Spirit as a dove descending, and remaining on him.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=11-#x">
              [11]
             </a>
             And there came a voice from heaven: Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=12-#x">
              [12]
             </a>
             And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the desert.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=13-#x">
              [13]
             </a>
             And he was in the desert forty days and forty nights, and was tempted by Satan; and he was with beasts, and the angels ministered to him.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=14-#x">
              [14]
             </a>
             And after that John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=15-#x">
              [15]
             </a>
             And saying: The time is accomplished, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent, and believe the gospel.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=16-#x">
              [16]
             </a>
             And passing by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother, casting nets into the sea (for they were fishermen).
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=17-#x">
              [17]
             </a>
             And Jesus said to them: Come after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=18-#x">
              [18]
             </a>
             And immediately leaving their nets, they followed him.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=19-#x">
              [19]
             </a>
             And going on from thence a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were mending their nets in the ship:
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=20-#x">
              [20]
             </a>
             And forthwith he called them. And leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with his hired men, they followed him.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=21-#x">
              [21]
             </a>
             And they entered into Capharnaum, and forthwith upon the sabbath days going into the synagogue, he taught them.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=22-#x">
              [22]
             </a>
             And they were astonished at his doctrine. For he was teaching them as one having power, and not as the scribes.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=23-#x">
              [23]
             </a>
             And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit; and he cried out,
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=24-#x">
              [24]
             </a>
             Saying: What have we to do with thee, Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art, the Holy One of God.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=25-#x">
              [25]
             </a>
             And Jesus threatened him, saying: Speak no more, and go out of the man.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=26-#x">
              [26]
             </a>
             And the unclean spirit tearing him, and crying out with a loud voice, went out of him.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=27-#x">
              [27]
             </a>
             And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying: What thing is this? what is this new doctrine? for with power he commandeth even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=28-#x">
              [28]
             </a>
             And the fame of him was spread forthwith into all the country of Galilee.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=29-#x">
              [29]
             </a>
             And immediately going out of the synagogue they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=30-#x">
              [30]
             </a>
             And Simon's wife's mother lay in a fit of a fever: and forthwith they tell him of her.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=31-#x">
              [31]
             </a>
             And coming to her, he lifted her up, taking her by the hand; and immediately the fever left her, and she ministered unto them.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=32-#x">
              [32]
             </a>
             And when it was evening, after sunset, they brought to him all that were ill and that were possessed with devils.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=33-#x">
              [33]
             </a>
             And all the city was gathered together at the door.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=34-#x">
              [34]
             </a>
             And he healed many that were troubled with divers diseases; and he cast out many devils, and he suffered them not to speak, because they knew him.

             And rising very early, going out, he went into a desert place: and there he prayed.
            </p>

             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=36-#x">
              [36]
             </a>
             And Simon, and they that were with him, followed after him.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=37-#x">
              [37]
             </a>
             And when they had found him, they said to him: All seek for thee.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=38-#x">
              [38]
             </a>
             And he saith to them: Let us go into the neighbouring towns and cities, that I may preach there also; for to this purpose am I come.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=39-#x">
              [39]
             </a>
             And he was preaching in their synagogues, and in all Galilee, and casting out devils.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=40-#x">
              [40]
             </a>
             And there came a leper to him, beseeching him, and kneeling down said to him: If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
            </p>
            <p>
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=41-#x">
              [41]
             </a>
             And Jesus having compassion on him, stretched forth his hand; and touching him, saith to him: I will. Be thou made clean.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=42-#x">
              [42]
             </a>
             And when he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=43-#x">
              [43]
             </a>
             And he strictly charged him, and forthwith sent him away.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=44-#x">
              [44]
             </a>
             And he saith to him: See thou tell no one; but go, shew thyself to the high priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.
             <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=1&amp;l=45-#x">
              [45]
             </a>
             But he being gone out, began to publish and to blaze abroad the word: so that he could not openly go into the city, but was without in desert places: and they flocked to him from all sides.

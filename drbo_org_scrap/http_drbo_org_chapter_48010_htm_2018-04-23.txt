               And Jesus looking on him, loved him, and said to him: One thing is wanting unto thee: go, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=10&amp;l=22-#x">

               And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus again answering, saith to them: Children, how hard is it for them that trust in riches, to enter into the kingdom of God?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=10&amp;l=25-#x">

               Who wondered the more, saying among themselves: Who then can be saved?

               And Jesus looking on them, saith: With men it is impossible; but not with God: for all things are possible with God.

               Jesus answering, said: Amen I say to you, there is no man who hath left house or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands, for my sake and for the gospel,

               And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem: and Jesus went before them, and they were astonished; and following were afraid. And taking again the twelve, he began to tell them the things that should befall him.

               And James and John the sons of Zebedee, come to him, saying: Master, we desire that whatsoever we shall ask, thou wouldst do it for us:

                [37]

               And they said: Grant to us, that we may sit, one on thy right hand, and the other on thy left hand, in thy glory.

               And Jesus said to them: You know not what you ask. Can you drink of the chalice that I drink of: or be baptized with the baptism wherewith I am baptized?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=10&amp;l=39-#x">
                [39]
               </a>
               But they said to him: We can. And Jesus saith to them: You shall indeed drink of the chalice that I drink of: and with the baptism wherewith I am baptized, you shall be baptized.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=10&amp;l=40-#x">

               But to sit on my right hand, or on my left, is not mine to give to you, but to them for whom it is prepared.

               And the ten hearing it, began to be much displeased at James and John.

                [42]

               But Jesus calling them, saith to them: You know that they who seem to rule over the Gentiles, lord it over them: and their princes have power over them.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=10&amp;l=43-#x">

               But it is not so among you: but whosoever will be greater, shall be your minister.

               And whosoever will be first among you, shall be the servant of all.

               For the Son of man also is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a redemption for many.

               And they came to Jericho: and as he went out of Jericho, with his disciples, and a very great multitude, Bartimeus the blind man, the son of Timeus, sat by the way side begging.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=10&amp;l=47-#x">

               Who when he had heard, that it was Jesus of Nazareth, began to cry out, and to say: Jesus son of David, have mercy on me.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=10&amp;l=48-#x">
                [48]
               </a>
               And many rebuked him, that he might hold his peace; but he cried a great deal the more: Son of David, have mercy on me.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=10&amp;l=49-#x">
                [49]
               </a>
               And Jesus, standing still, commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying to him: Be of better comfort: arise, he calleth thee.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=10&amp;l=50-#x">

               And Jesus answering, said to him: What wilt thou that I should do to thee? And the blind man said to him: Rabboni, that I may see.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=48&amp;ch=10&amp;l=52-#x">

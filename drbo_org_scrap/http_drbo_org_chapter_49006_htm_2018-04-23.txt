               , that as he went through the corn fields, his disciples plucked the ears, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.

                [2]

                [3]

               And Jesus answering them, said: Have you not read so much as this, what David did, when himself was hungry, and they that were with him:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=6&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]

               How he went into the house of God, and took and ate the bread of proposition, and gave to them that were with him, which is not lawful to eat but only for the priests?

                [5]

               And he said to them: The Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath.

               And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the synagogue, and taught. And there was a man, whose right hand was withered.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=6&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               And the scribes and Pharisees watched if he would heal on the sabbath; that they might find an accusation against him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=6&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]

               But he knew their thoughts; and said to the man who had the withered hand: Arise, and stand forth in the midst. And rising he stood forth.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=6&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               Then Jesus said to them: I ask you, if it be lawful on the sabbath days to do good, or to do evil; to save life, or to destroy?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=6&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]
               </a>
               And looking round about on them all, he said to the man: Stretch forth thy hand. And he stretched it forth: and his hand was restored.
              </p>
              <p>

                [11]
               </a>
               And they were filled with madness; and they talked one with another, what they might do to Jesus.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=6&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               And it came to pass in those days, that he went out into a mountain to pray, and he passed the whole night in the prayer of God.

               And when day was come, he called unto him his disciples; and he chose twelve of them (whom also he named apostles).

                [17]
               </a>
               And coming down with them, he stood in a plain place, and the company of his disciples, and a very great multitude of people from all Judea and Jerusalem, and the sea coast both of Tyre and Sidon,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=6&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]

               Who were come to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases. And they that were troubled with unclean spirits, were cured.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=6&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               And all the multitude sought to touch him, for virtue went out from him, and healed all.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=6&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]
               </a>
               And he, lifting up his eyes on his disciples, said: Blessed are ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.

               Blessed shall you be when men shall hate you, and when they shall separate you, and shall reproach you, and cast out your name as evil, for the Son of man's sake.

               Or how canst thou say to thy brother: Brother, let me pull the mote out of thy eye, when thou thyself seest not the beam in thy own eye? Hypocrite, cast first the beam out of thy own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to take out the mote from thy brother's eye.

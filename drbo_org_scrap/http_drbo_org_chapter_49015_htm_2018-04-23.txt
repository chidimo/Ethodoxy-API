               The parables of the lost sheep and of the prodigal son.

                [1]

               Now the publicans and sinners drew near unto him to hear him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]
               </a>
               And the Pharisees and the scribes murmured, saying: This man receiveth sinners, and eateth with them.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               And he spoke to them this parable, saying:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               What man of you that hath an hundred sheep: and if he shall lose one of them, doth he not leave the ninety-nine in the desert, and go after that which was lost, until he find it?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               And when he hath found it, lay it upon his shoulders, rejoicing:
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=6-#x">
                [6]
               </a>
               And coming home, call together his friends and neighbours, saying to them: Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               I say to you, that even so there shall be joy in heaven upon one sinner that doth penance, more than upon ninety-nine just who need not penance.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]

               Or what woman having ten groats; if she lose one groat, doth not light a candle, and sweep the house, and seek diligently until she find it?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               And when she hath found it, call together her friends and neighbours, saying: Rejoice with me, because I have found the groat which I had lost.

               <u>
                before the angels
               </u>
               of God upon one sinner doing penance.

                "Before the angels"

               : By this it is plain that the spirits in heaven have a concern for us below, and a joy at our repentance and consequently a knowledge of it.

                [11]
               </a>
               And he said: A certain man had two sons:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               And the younger of them said to his father: Father, give me the portion of substance that falleth to me. And he divided unto them his substance.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               And not many days after, the younger son, gathering all together, went abroad into a far country: and there wasted his substance, living riotously.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               And after he had spent all, there came a mighty famine in that country; and he began to be in want.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               And he went and cleaved to one of the citizens of that country. And he sent him into his farm to feed swine.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=16-#x">
                [16]
               </a>
               And he would fain have filled his belly with the husks the swine did eat; and no man gave unto him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               And returning to himself, he said: How many hired servants in my father's house abound with bread, and I here perish with hunger?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               I will arise, and will go to my father, and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               I am not worthy to be called thy son: make me as one of thy hired servants.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]
               </a>
               And rising up he came to his father. And when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and was moved with compassion, and running to him fell upon his neck, and kissed him.

              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=21-#x">
                [21]
               </a>
               And the son said to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven, and before thee, I am not now worthy to be called thy son.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=22-#x">
                [22]
               </a>
               And the father said to his servants: Bring forth quickly the first robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=23-#x">
                [23]
               </a>
               And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat and make merry:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=24-#x">
                [24]
               </a>
               Because this my son was dead, and is come to life again: was lost, and is found. And they began to be merry.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=25-#x">
                [25]
               </a>
               Now his elder son was in the field, and when he came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing:
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=26-#x">
                [26]
               </a>
               And he called one of the servants, and asked what these things meant.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=27-#x">
                [27]
               </a>
               And he said to him: Thy brother is come, and thy father hath killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him safe.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=28-#x">
                [28]
               </a>
               And he was angry, and would not go in. His father therefore coming out began to entreat him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=29-#x">
                [29]
               </a>
               And he answering, said to his father: Behold, for so many years do I serve thee, and I have never transgressed thy commandment, and yet thou hast never given me a kid to make merry with my friends:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=30-#x">
                [30]
               </a>
               But as soon as this thy son is come, who hath devoured his substance with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted calf.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=31-#x">
                [31]
               </a>
               But he said to him: Son, thou art always with me, and all I have is thine.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=15&amp;l=32-#x">
                [32]
               </a>
               But it was fit that we should make merry and be glad, for this thy brother was dead and is come to life again; he was lost, and is found.

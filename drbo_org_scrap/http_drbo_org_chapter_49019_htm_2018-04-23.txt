               Zacheus entertains Christ. The parable of the pounds. Christ rides upon an ass and weeps over Jerusalem.

               And entering in, he walked through Jericho.

               And behold, there was a man named Zacheus, who was the chief of the publicans, and he was rich.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]

               And he sought to see Jesus who he was, and he could not for the crowd, because he was low of stature.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]

               And running before, he climbed up into a sycamore tree, that he might see him; for he was to pass that way.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               And when Jesus was come to the place, looking up, he saw him, and said to him: Zacheus, make haste and come down; for this day I must abide in thy house.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=6-#x">

               And he made haste and came down; and received him with joy.

                [7]
               </a>
               And when all saw it, they murmured, saying, that he was gone to be a guest with a man that was a sinner.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]

               But Zacheus standing, said to the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wronged any man of any thing, I restore him fourfold.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]

               Jesus said to him: This day is salvation come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham.

               As they were hearing these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately be manifested.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]

               He said therefore: A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=13-#x">

                [14]

               But his citizens hated him: and they sent an embassage after him, saying: We will not have this man to reign over us.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               And it came to pass, that he returned, having received the kingdom: and he commanded his servants to be called, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading.

                [21]
               </a>
               For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up what thou didst not lay down, and thou reapest that which thou didst not sow.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=22-#x">
                [22]
               </a>
               He saith to him: Out of thy own mouth I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping that which I did not sow:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=23-#x">
                [23]
               </a>
               And why then didst thou not give my money into the bank, that at my coming, I might have exacted it with usury?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=24-#x">
                [24]
               </a>
               And he said to them that stood by: Take the pound away from him, and give it to him that hath ten pounds.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=25-#x">
                [25]
               </a>
               And they said to him: Lord, he hath ten pounds.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=26-#x">
                [26]
               </a>
               But I say to you, that to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: and from him that hath not, even that which he hath, shall be taken from him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=27-#x">
                [27]
               </a>
               But as for those my enemies, who would not have me reign over them, bring them hither, and kill them before me.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=28-#x">
                [28]
               </a>
               And having said these things, he went before, going up to Jerusalem.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=29-#x">
                [29]
               </a>
               And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethania, unto the mount called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=30-#x">
                [30]
               </a>
               Saying: Go into the town which is over against you, at your entering into which you shall find the colt of an ass tied, on which no man ever hath sitten: loose him, and bring him hither.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=31-#x">
                [31]
               </a>
               And if any man shall ask you: Why do you loose him? you shall say thus unto him: Because the Lord hath need of his service.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=32-#x">
                [32]
               </a>
               And they that were sent, went their way, and found the colt standing, as he had said unto them.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=33-#x">
                [33]
               </a>
               And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said to them: Why loose you the colt?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=34-#x">
                [34]
               </a>
               But they said: Because the Lord hath need of him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=35-#x">
                [35]
               </a>
               And they brought him to Jesus. And casting their garments on the colt, they set Jesus thereon.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=36-#x">
                [36]
               </a>
               And as he went, they spread their clothes underneath in the way.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=37-#x">
                [37]
               </a>
               And when he was now coming near the descent of mount Olivet, the whole multitude of his disciples began with joy to praise God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works they had seen,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=38-#x">
                [38]
               </a>
               Saying: Blessed be the king who cometh in the name of the Lord, peace in heaven, and glory on high!
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=39-#x">
                [39]
               </a>
               And some of the Pharisees, from amongst the multitude, said to him: Master, rebuke thy disciples.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=40-#x">
                [40]
               </a>
               To whom he said: I say to you, that if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=41-#x">
                [41]
               </a>
               And when he drew near, seeing the city, he wept over it, saying:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=42-#x">
                [42]
               </a>
               If thou also hadst known, and that in this thy day, the things that are to thy peace; but now they are hidden from thy eyes.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=43-#x">
                [43]
               </a>
               For the days shall come upon thee, and thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and straiten thee on every side,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=44-#x">
                [44]
               </a>
               And beat thee flat to the ground, and thy children who are in thee: and they shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone: because thou hast not known the time of thy visitation.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=45-#x">
                [45]
               </a>
               And entering into the temple, he began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=46-#x">
                [46]
               </a>
               Saying to them: It is written: My house is the house of prayer. But you have made it a den of thieves.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=47-#x">
                [47]
               </a>
               And he was teaching daily in the temple. And the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people sought to destroy him:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=19&amp;l=48-#x">
                [48]
               </a>
               And they found not what to do to him: for all the people were very attentive to hear him.

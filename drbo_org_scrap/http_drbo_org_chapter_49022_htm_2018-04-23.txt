               Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the pasch, was at hand.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=22&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]

               And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put Jesus to death: but they feared the people.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=22&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]

               And Satan entered into Judas, who was surnamed Iscariot, one of the twelve.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=22&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               And he went, and discoursed with the chief priests and the magistrates, how he might betray him to them.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=22&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]

               And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money.

               And he promised. And he sought opportunity to betray him in the absence of the multitude.

                [7]

               And the day of the unleavened bread came, on which it was necessary that the pasch should be killed.

                [8]

               And he sent Peter and John, saying: Go, and prepare for us the pasch, that we may eat.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=22&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]

                [10]

               And he said to them: Behold, as you go into the city, there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water: follow him into the house where he entereth in.
              </p>
              <p>

               And you shall say to the goodman of the house: The master saith to thee, Where is the guest chamber, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=22&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]

               And he will shew you a large dining room, furnished; and there prepare.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=22&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               And they going, found as he had said to them, and made ready the pasch.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=22&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=22&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               And he said to them: With desire I have desired to eat this pasch with you, before I suffer.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=22&amp;l=16-#x">
                [16]

               For I say to you, that from this time I will not eat it, till it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God.

                [17]
               </a>
               And having taken the chalice, he gave thanks, and said: Take, and divide it among you:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=22&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               For I say to you, that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, till the kingdom of God come.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=22&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               And taking bread, he gave thanks, and brake; and gave to them, saying: This is my body, which is given for you.

               In like manner the chalice also, after he had supped, saying: This is the chalice, the new testament in my blood, which shall be shed for you.

                "Do this for a commemoration of me"
               </u>
               : This sacrifice and sacrament is to be continued in the church, to the end of the world, to shew forth the death of Christ, until he cometh. But this commemoration, or remembrance, is by no means inconsistent with the real presence of his body and blood, under these sacramental veils, which represent his death; on the contrary, it is the manner that he himself hath commanded, of commemorating and celebrating his death, by offering in sacrifice, and receiving in the sacrament, that body and blood by which we were redeemed.

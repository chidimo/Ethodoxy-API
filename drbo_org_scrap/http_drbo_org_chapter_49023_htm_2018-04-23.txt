               And the whole multitude of them rising up, led him to Pilate.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=23&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]
               </a>
               And they began to accuse him, saying: We have found this man perverting our nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, and saying that he is Christ the king.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=23&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               And Pilate asked him, saying: Art thou the king of the Jews? But he answering, said: Thou sayest it.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=23&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               And Pilate said to the chief priests and to the multitudes: I find no cause in this man.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=23&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               But they were more earnest, saying: He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=23&amp;l=6-#x">
                [6]
               </a>
               But Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the man were of Galilee?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=23&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               And when he understood that he was of Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him away to Herod, who was also himself at Jerusalem, in those days.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=23&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]
               </a>
               And Herod, seeing Jesus, was very glad; for he was desirous of a long time to see him, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to see some sign wrought by him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=23&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               And he questioned him in many words. But he answered him nothing.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=23&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]
               </a>
               And the chief priests and the scribes stood by, earnestly accusing him.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=23&amp;l=11-#x">
                [11]
               </a>
               And Herod with his army set him at nought, and mocked him, putting on him a white garment, and sent him back to Pilate.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=23&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               And Herod and Pilate were made friends, that same day; for before they were enemies one to another.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=23&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               And Pilate, calling together the chief priests, and the magistrates, and the people,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=23&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               Said to them: You have presented unto me this man, as one that perverteth the people; and behold I, having examined him before you, find no cause in this man, in those things wherein you accuse him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=23&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               No, nor Herod neither. For I sent you to him, and behold, nothing worthy of death is done to him.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=23&amp;l=16-#x">
                [16]
               </a>
               I will chastise him therefore, and release him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=23&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               Now of necessity he was to release unto them one upon the feast day.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=23&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               But the whole multitude together cried out, saying: Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=23&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               Who, for a certain sedition made in the city, and for a murder, was cast into prison.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=23&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]
               </a>
               And Pilate again spoke to them, desiring to release Jesus.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=23&amp;l=21-#x">
                [21]
               </a>
               But they cried again, saying: Crucify him, crucify him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=23&amp;l=22-#x">
                [22]
               </a>
               And he said to them the third time: Why, what evil hath this man done? I find no cause of death in him. I will chastise him therefore, and let him go.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=49&amp;ch=23&amp;l=23-#x">
                [23]

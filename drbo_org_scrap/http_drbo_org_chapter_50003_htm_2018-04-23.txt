               And there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=3&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]

               This man came to Jesus by night, and said to him: Rabbi, we know that thou art come a teacher from God; for no man can do these signs which thou dost, unless God be with him.

                [3]
               </a>
               Jesus answered, and said to him: Amen, amen I say to thee, unless a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=3&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               Nicodemus saith to him: How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born again?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=3&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]

               That which is born of the flesh, is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is spirit.

               The Spirit breatheth where he will; and thou hearest his voice, but thou knowest not whence he cometh, and whither he goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.

               And no man hath ascended into heaven, but he that descended from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.

                [16]

               For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son; that whosoever believeth in him, may not perish, but may have life everlasting.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=3&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]

               For God sent not his Son into the world, to judge the world, but that the world may be saved by him.

                [20]

               For every one that doth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, that his works may not be reproved.

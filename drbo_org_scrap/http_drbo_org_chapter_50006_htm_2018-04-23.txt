               Christ feeds five thousand with five loaves. He walks upon the sea and discourses of the bread of life.

               After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is that of Tiberias.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=6&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]
               </a>
               And a great multitude followed him, because they saw the miracles which he did on them that were diseased.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=6&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               Jesus therefore went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=6&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               Now the pasch, the festival day of the Jews, was near at hand.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=6&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               When Jesus therefore had lifted up his eyes, and seen that a very great multitude cometh to him, he said to Philip: Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=6&amp;l=6-#x">
                [6]
               </a>
               And this he said to try him; for he himself knew what he would do.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=6&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               Philip answered him: Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one may take a little.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=6&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]
               </a>
               One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, saith to him:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=6&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               There is a boy here that hath five barley loaves, and two fishes; but what are these among so many?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=6&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]
               </a>
               Then Jesus said: Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. The men therefore sat down, in number about five thousand.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=6&amp;l=11-#x">
                [11]
               </a>
               And Jesus took the loaves: and when he had given thanks, he distributed to them that were set down. In like manner also of the fishes, as much as they would.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=6&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               And when they were filled, he said to his disciples: Gather up the fragments that remain, lest they be lost.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=6&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               They gathered up therefore, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which remained over and above to them that had eaten.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=6&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               Now those men, when they had seen what a miracle Jesus had done, said: This is of a truth the prophet, that is to come into the world.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=6&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               Jesus therefore, when he knew that they would come to take him by force, and make him king, fled again into the mountain himself alone.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=6&amp;l=16-#x">
                [16]
               </a>
               And when evening was come, his disciples went down to the sea.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=6&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               And when they had gone up into a ship, they went over the sea to Capharnaum; and it was now dark, and Jesus was not come unto them.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=6&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               And the sea arose, by reason of a great wind that blew.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=6&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               When they had rowed therefore about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking upon the sea, and drawing nigh to the ship, and they were afraid.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=6&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]
               </a>
               But he saith to them: It is I; be not afraid.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=6&amp;l=21-#x">
                [21]
               </a>
               They were willing therefore to take him into the ship; and presently the ship was at the land to which they were going.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=6&amp;l=22-#x">
                [22]
               </a>
               The next day, the multitude that stood on the other side of the sea, saw that there was no other ship there but one, and that Jesus had not entered into the ship with his disciples, but that his disciples were gone away alone.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=6&amp;l=23-#x">
                [23]
               </a>
               But other ships came in from Tiberias; nigh unto the place where they had eaten the bread, the Lord giving thanks.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=6&amp;l=24-#x">
                [24]
               </a>
               When therefore the multitude saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they took shipping, and came to Capharnaum, seeking for Jesus.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=6&amp;l=25-#x">
                [25]

               The woman taken in adultery. Christ justifies his doctrine.

                [1]

               And Jesus went unto mount Olivet.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]
               </a>
               And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came to him, and sitting down he taught them.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               And the scribes and the Pharisees bring unto him a woman taken in adultery: and they set her in the midst,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               And said to him: Master, this woman was even now taken in adultery.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               Now Moses in the law commanded us to stone such a one. But what sayest thou?
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=6-#x">
                [6]
               </a>
               And this they said tempting him, that they might accuse him. But Jesus bowing himself down, wrote with his finger on the ground.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               When therefore they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said to them: He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]
               </a>
               And again stooping down, he wrote on the ground.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               But they hearing this, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest. And Jesus alone remained, and the woman standing in the midst.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]
               </a>
               Then Jesus lifting up himself, said to her: Woman, where are they that accused thee? Hath no man condemned thee?
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=11-#x">
                [11]
               </a>
               Who said: No man, Lord. And Jesus said: Neither will I condemn thee. Go, and now sin no more.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               Again therefore, Jesus spoke to them, saying: I am the light of the world: he that followeth me, walketh not in darkness, but shall have the light of life.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               The Pharisees therefore said to him: Thou givest testimony of thyself: thy testimony is not true.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               Jesus answered, and said to them: Although I give testimony of myself, my testimony is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go: but you know not whence I come, or whither I go.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               You judge according to the flesh: I judge not any man.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=16-#x">
                [16]
               </a>
               And if I do judge, my judgment is true: because I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               And in your law it is written, that the testimony of two men is true.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               I am one that give testimony of myself: and the Father that sent me giveth testimony of me.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               They said therefore to him: Where is thy Father? Jesus answered: Neither me do you know, nor my Father: if you did know me, perhaps you would know my Father also.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]
               </a>
               These words Jesus spoke in the treasury, teaching in the temple: and no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=21-#x">
                [21]
               </a>
               Again therefore Jesus said to them: I go, and you shall seek me, and you shall die in your sin. Whither I go, you cannot come.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=22-#x">
                [22]
               </a>
               The Jews therefore said: Will he kill himself, because he said: Whither I go, you cannot come?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=23-#x">
                [23]
               </a>
               And he said to them: You are from beneath, I am from above. You are of this world, I am not of this world.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=24-#x">
                [24]
               </a>
               Therefore I said to you, that you shall die in your sins. For if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sin.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=25-#x">
                [25]

               They said therefore to him: Who art thou? Jesus said to them: The beginning, who also speak unto you.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=26-#x">
                [26]
               </a>
               Many things I have to speak and to judge of you. But he that sent me, is true: and the things I have heard of him, these same I speak in the world.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=27-#x">
                [27]
               </a>
               And they understood not, that he called God his Father.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=28-#x">
                [28]
               </a>
               Jesus therefore said to them: When you shall have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know, that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself, but as the Father hath taught me, these things I speak:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=29-#x">
                [29]
               </a>
               And he that sent me, is with me, and he hath not left me alone: for I do always the things that please him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=30-#x">
                [30]
               </a>
               When he spoke these things, many believed in him.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=31-#x">
                [31]
               </a>
               Then Jesus said to those Jews, who believed him: If you continue in my word, you shall be my disciples indeed.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=32-#x">
                [32]
               </a>
               And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=33-#x">
                [33]
               </a>
               They answered him: We are the seed of Abraham, and we have never been slaves to any man: how sayest thou: you shall be free?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=34-#x">
                [34]
               </a>
               Jesus answered them: Amen, amen I say unto you: that whosoever committeth sin, is the servant of sin.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=35-#x">
                [35]
               </a>
               Now the servant abideth not in the house for ever; but the son abideth for ever.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=36-#x">
                [36]
               </a>
               If therefore the son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=37-#x">
                [37]
               </a>
               I know that you are the children of Abraham: but you seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=38-#x">
                [38]
               </a>
               I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and you do the things that you have seen with your father.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=39-#x">
                [39]
               </a>
               They answered, and said to him: Abraham is our father. Jesus saith to them: If you be the children of Abraham, do the works of Abraham.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=40-#x">
                [40]
               </a>
               But now you seek to kill me, a man who have spoken the truth to you, which I have heard of God. This Abraham did not.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=41-#x">
                [41]
               </a>
               You do the works of your father. They said therefore to him: We are not born of fornication: we have one Father, even God.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=42-#x">
                [42]
               </a>
               Jesus therefore said to them: If God were your Father, you would indeed love me. For from God I proceeded, and came; for I came not of myself, but he sent me:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=43-#x">
                [43]
               </a>
               Why do you not know my speech? Because you cannot hear my word.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=44-#x">
                [44]
               </a>
               You are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father you will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and he stood not in the truth; because truth is not in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father thereof.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=45-#x">
                [45]
               </a>
               But if I say the truth, you believe me not.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=46-#x">
                [46]
               </a>
               Which of you shall convict me of sin? If I say the truth to you, why do you not believe me?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=47-#x">
                [47]
               </a>
               He that is of God, heareth the words of God. Therefore you hear them not, because you are not of God.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=48-#x">
                [48]
               </a>
               The Jews therefore answered, and said to him: Do not we say well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=49-#x">
                [49]
               </a>
               Jesus answered: I have not a devil: but I honour my Father, and you have dishonoured me.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=50-#x">
                [50]
               </a>
               But I seek not my own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=51-#x">
                [51]
               </a>
               Amen, amen I say to you: If any man keep my word, he shall not see death for ever.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=52-#x">
                [52]
               </a>
               The Jews therefore said: Now we know that thou hast a devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest: If any man keep my word, he shall not taste death for ever.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=53-#x">
                [53]
               </a>
               Art thou greater than our father Abraham, who is dead? and the prophets are dead. Whom dost thou make thyself?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=54-#x">
                [54]
               </a>
               Jesus answered: If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father that glorifieth me, of whom you say that he is your God.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=55-#x">
                [55]
               </a>
               And you have not known him, but I know him. And if I shall say that I know him not, I shall be like to you, a liar. But I do know him, and do keep his word.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=56-#x">
                [56]
               </a>
               Abraham your father rejoiced that he might see my day: he saw it, and was glad.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=57-#x">
                [57]

               The Jews therefore said to him: Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=58-#x">
                [58]
               </a>
               Jesus said to them: Amen, amen I say to you, before Abraham was made, I am.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=8&amp;l=59-#x">
                [59]

               They took up stones therefore to cast at him. But Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.

                [1]
               </a>
               And Jesus passing by, saw a man, who was blind from his birth:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]
               </a>
               And his disciples asked him: Rabbi, who hath sinned, this man, or his parents, that he should be born blind?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               Jesus answered: Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents; but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               I must work the works of him that sent me, whilst it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=6-#x">
                [6]
               </a>
               When he had said these things, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and spread the clay on his eyes,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               And said to him: Go, wash in the pool of Siloe, which is interpreted, Sent. He went therefore, and washed, and he came seeing.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]
               </a>
               The neighbours therefore, and they who had seen him before that he was a beggar, said: Is not this he that sat and begged? Some said: This is he.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               But others said: No, but he is like him. But he said: I am he.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]
               </a>
               They said therefore to him: How were thy eyes opened?
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=11-#x">
                [11]
               </a>
               He answered: That man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed my eyes, and said to me: Go to the pool of Siloe, and wash. And I went, I washed, and I see.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               And they said to him: Where is he? He saith: I know not.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               They bring him that had been blind to the Pharisees.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               Now it was the sabbath, when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               Again therefore the Pharisees asked him, how he had received his sight. But he said to them: He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed, and I see.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=16-#x">
                [16]
               </a>
               Some therefore of the Pharisees said: This man is not of God, who keepeth not the sabbath. But others said: How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               They say therefore to the blind man again: What sayest thou of him that hath opened thy eyes? And he said: He is a prophet.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               The Jews then did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               And asked them, saying: Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then doth he now see?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]
               </a>
               His parents answered them, and said: We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=21-#x">
                [21]
               </a>
               But how he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: ask himself: he is of age, let him speak for himself.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=22-#x">
                [22]
               </a>
               These things his parents said, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had already agreed among themselves, that if any man should confess him to be Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=23-#x">
                [23]
               </a>
               Therefore did his parents say: He is of age, ask himself.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=24-#x">
                [24]
               </a>
               They therefore called the man again that had been blind, and said to him: Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=25-#x">
                [25]
               </a>
               He said therefore to them: If he be a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that whereas I was blind, now I see.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=26-#x">
                [26]
               </a>
               They said then to him: What did he to thee? How did he open thy eyes?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=27-#x">
                [27]
               </a>
               He answered them: I have told you already, and you have heard: why would you hear it again? will you also become his disciples?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=28-#x">
                [28]
               </a>
               They reviled him therefore, and said: Be thou his disciple; but we are the disciples of Moses.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=29-#x">
                [29]
               </a>
               We know that God spoke to Moses: but as to this man, we know not from whence he is.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=30-#x">
                [30]
               </a>
               The man answered, and said to them: Why, herein is a wonderful thing, that you know not from whence he is, and he hath opened my eyes.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=31-#x">
                [31]
               </a>
               Now we know that God doth not hear sinners: but if a man be a server of God, and doth his will, him he heareth.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=32-#x">
                [32]
               </a>
               From the beginning of the world it hath not been heard, that any man hath opened the eyes of one born blind.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=33-#x">
                [33]
               </a>
               Unless this man were of God, he could not do any thing.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=34-#x">
                [34]
               </a>
               They answered, and said to him: Thou wast wholly born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=35-#x">
                [35]
               </a>
               Jesus heard that they had cast him out: and when he had found him, he said to him: Dost thou believe in the Son of God?
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=36-#x">
                [36]
               </a>
               He answered, and said: Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=37-#x">
                [37]
               </a>
               And Jesus said to him: Thou hast both seen him; and it is he that talketh with thee.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=38-#x">
                [38]
               </a>
               And he said: I believe, Lord. And falling down, he adored him.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=39-#x">
                [39]
               </a>
               And Jesus said: For judgment
               <u>
                I am come
               </u>
               into this world; that they who see not, may see; and they who see, may become blind.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=40-#x">
                [40]
               </a>
               And some of the Pharisees, who were with him, heard: and they said unto him: Are we also blind?
              </p>
              <p class="note">
               [39]
               <u>
                "I am come"
               </u>
               : Not that Christ came for that end, that any one should be made blind: but that the Jews, by the abuse of his coming, and by their not receiving him, brought upon themselves this judgment of blindness.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=50&amp;ch=9&amp;l=41-#x">
                [41]
               </a>
               Jesus said to them:
               <u>
                If you were blind
               </u>
               , you should not have sin: but now you say: We see. Your sin remaineth.
              </p>
              <p class="note">
               [41]
               <u>
                "If you were blind"
               </u>
               : If you were invincibly ignorant, and had neither read the scriptures, nor seen my miracles, you would not be guilty of the sin of infidelity: but now, as you boast of your knowledge of the scriptures, you are inexcusable.

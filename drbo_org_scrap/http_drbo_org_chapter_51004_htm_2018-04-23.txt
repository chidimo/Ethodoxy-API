               And as they were speaking to the people, the priests, and the officer of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=4&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]

               Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached in Jesus the resurrection from the dead:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=4&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]
               </a>
               And they laid hands upon them, and put them in hold till the next day; for it was now evening.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=4&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               But many of them who had heard the word, believed; and the number of the men was made five thousand.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=4&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               And it came to pass on the morrow, that their princes, and ancients, and scribes, were gathered together in Jerusalem;
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=4&amp;l=6-#x">
                [6]
               </a>
               And Annas the high priest, and Caiphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=4&amp;l=7-#x">
                [7]
               </a>
               And setting them in the midst, they asked: By what power, or by what name, have you done this?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=4&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]
               </a>
               Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said to them: Ye princes of the people, and ancients, hear:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=4&amp;l=9-#x">
                [9]
               </a>
               If we this day are examined concerning the good deed done to the infirm man, by what means he hath been made whole:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=4&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]
               </a>
               Be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God hath raised from the dead, even by him this man standeth here before you whole.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=4&amp;l=11-#x">
                [11]
               </a>
               This is the stone which was rejected by you the builders, which is become the head of the corner.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=4&amp;l=12-#x">
                [12]
               </a>
               Neither is there salvation in any other. For there is no other name under heaven given to men, whereby we must be saved.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=4&amp;l=13-#x">
                [13]
               </a>
               Now seeing the constancy of Peter and of John, understanding that they were illiterate and ignorant men, they wondered; and they knew them that they had been with Jesus.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=4&amp;l=14-#x">
                [14]
               </a>
               Seeing the man also who had been healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=4&amp;l=15-#x">
                [15]
               </a>
               But they commanded them to go aside out of the council; and they conferred among themselves,
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=4&amp;l=16-#x">
                [16]
               </a>
               Saying: What shall we do to these men? for indeed a known miracle hath been done by them, to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: it is manifest, and we cannot deny it.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=4&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               But that it may be no farther spread among the people, let us threaten them that they speak no more in this name to any man.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=4&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               And calling them, they charged them not to speak at all, nor teach in the name of Jesus.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=4&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               But Peter and John answering, said to them: If it be just in the sight of God, to hear you rather than God, judge ye.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=51&amp;ch=4&amp;l=20-#x">

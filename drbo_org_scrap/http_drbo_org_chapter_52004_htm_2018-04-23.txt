               Abraham was not justified by works done, as of himself, but by grace and by faith. And that before he was circumcised. Gentiles, by faith, are his children.

               : That is, if they alone, who follow the ceremonies of the law, be heirs of the blessings promised to Abraham; then that faith which was so much praised in him, will be found to be of little value. And the very promise will be made void, by which he was promised to be the father, not of the Jews only, but of all nations of believers.

                "The law worketh wrath"
               </u>
               : The law, abstracting from faith and grace, worketh wrath occasionally, by being an occasion of many transgressions, which provoke God's wrath.

               Therefore is it of faith, that according to grace the promise might be firm to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=52&amp;ch=4&amp;l=17-#x">
                [17]
               </a>
               (As it is written: I have made thee a father of many nations,) before God, whom he believed, who quickeneth the dead; and calleth those things that are not, as those that are.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=52&amp;ch=4&amp;l=18-#x">
                [18]
               </a>
               Who against hope believed in hope; that he might be made the father of many nations, according to that which was said to him: So shall thy seed be.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=52&amp;ch=4&amp;l=19-#x">
                [19]
               </a>
               And he was not weak in faith; neither did he consider his own body now dead, whereas he was almost an hundred years old, nor the dead womb of Sara.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=52&amp;ch=4&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]
               </a>
               In the promise also of God he staggered not by distrust; but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God:
              </p>

                [21]
               </a>
               Most fully knowing, that whatsoever he has promised, he is able also to perform.

                [22]
               </a>
               And therefore it was reputed to him unto justice.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=52&amp;ch=4&amp;l=23-#x">
                [23]
               </a>
               Now it is not written only for him, that it was reputed to him unto justice,
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=52&amp;ch=4&amp;l=24-#x">
                [24]

               But also for us, to whom it shall be reputed, if we believe in him, that raised up Jesus Christ, our Lord, from the dead,

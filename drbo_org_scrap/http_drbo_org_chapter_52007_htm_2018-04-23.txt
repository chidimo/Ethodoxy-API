But these evil motions, (though they are called the law of sin, because they come from original sin, and violently tempt and incline to sin,) as long as the will does not consent to them, are not sins, because they are not voluntary.

                [19]
               </a>
               For the good which I will, I do not; but the evil which I will not, that I do.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=52&amp;ch=7&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]
               </a>
               Now if I do that which I will not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
              </p>
              <p>
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=52&amp;ch=7&amp;l=21-#x">
                [21]
               </a>
               I find then a law, that when I have a will to do good, evil is present with me.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=52&amp;ch=7&amp;l=22-#x">
                [22]
               </a>
               For I am delighted with the law of God, according to the inward man:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=52&amp;ch=7&amp;l=23-#x">
                [23]
               </a>
               But I see another law in my members, fighting against the law of my mind, and captivating me in the law of sin, that is in my members.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=52&amp;ch=7&amp;l=24-#x">
                [24]
               </a>
               Unhappy man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=52&amp;ch=7&amp;l=25-#x">
                [25]
               </a>
               The grace of God, by Jesus Christ our Lord. Therefore, I myself, with the mind serve the law of God; but with the flesh, the law of sin.

               There is no condemnation to them that, being justified by Christ, walk not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit. Their strong hope and love of God.

               There is now therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh.

                [3]
               </a>
               For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh; God sending his own Son, in the likeness of sinful flesh and of sin, hath condemned sin in the flesh;
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=52&amp;ch=8&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]
               </a>
               That the justification of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=52&amp;ch=8&amp;l=5-#x">
                [5]
               </a>
               For they that are according to the flesh, mind the things that are of the flesh; but they that are according to the spirit, mind the things that are of the spirit.

               But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.

               And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead, dwell in you; he that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead, shall quicken also your mortal bodies, because of his Spirit that dwelleth in you.

               For if you live according to the flesh, you shall die: but if by the Spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh, you shall live.

                [14]

               For whosoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.

               For you have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear; but you have received the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry: Abba (Father).

               : By the inward motions of divine love, and the peace of conscience, which the children of God experience, they have a kind of testimony of God's favour; by which they are much strengthened in their hope of their justification and salvation; but yet not so as to pretend to an absolute assurance: which is not usually granted in this mortal life: during which we are taught to work out our salvation with fear and trembling. Phil. 2. 12. And that he that thinketh himself to stand, must take heed lest he fall. 1 Cor. 10. 12. See also, Rom. 11. 20, 21, 22.

               : He speaks of the corporeal creation, made for the use and service of man; and, by occasion of his sin, made subject to vanity, that is, to a perpetual instability, tending to corruption and other defects; so that by a figure of speech it is here said to groan and be in labour, and to long for its deliverance, which is then to come, when sin shall reign no more; and God shall raise the bodies and unite them to their souls never more to separate, and to be in everlasting happiness in heaven.

               </a>
               For we know that every creature groaneth and travaileth in pain, even till now.

               And not only it, but ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption of the sons of God, the redemption of our body.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=52&amp;ch=8&amp;l=24-#x">

               For we are saved by hope. But hope that is seen, is not hope. For what a man seeth, why doth he hope for?
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=52&amp;ch=8&amp;l=25-#x">

               But if we hope for that which we see not, we wait for it with patience.

               Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmity. For we know not what we should pray for as we ought; but the Spirit himself
               <u>
                asketh for us
               </u>

               </a>
               I have not written to you as to them that know not the truth, but as to them that know it: and that no lie is of the truth.

               Who is a liar, but he who denieth that Jesus is the Christ? This is Antichrist, who denieth the Father, and the Son.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=69&amp;ch=2&amp;l=23-#x">
                [23]

               Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father. He that confesseth the Son, hath the Father also.

               As for you, let that which you have heard from the beginning, abide in you. If that abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning, you also shall abide in the Son, and in the Father.

               And this is the promise which he hath promised us, life everlasting.

               These things have I written to you, concerning them that seduce you.

                you have no need
               </u>
               that any man teach you; but as his unction teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie. And as it hath taught you, abide in him.

               And now, little children, abide in him, that when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be confounded by him at his coming.

               If you know, that he is just, know ye, that every one also, who doth justice, is born of him.

               : You want not to be taught by any of these men, who, under pretence of imparting more knowledge to you, seek to seduce you (ver. 26), since you are sufficiently taught already, and have all knowledge and grace in the church, with the unction of the Holy Ghost; which these new teachers have no share in.

               And I beheld, and lo a lamb stood upon mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty-four thousand, having his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=73&amp;ch=14&amp;l=2-#x">
                [2]

               And I heard a voice from heaven, as the noise of many waters, and as the voice of great thunder; and the voice which I heard, was as the voice of harpers, harping on their harps.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=73&amp;ch=14&amp;l=3-#x">
                [3]

               And they sung as it were a new canticle, before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the ancients; and no man could say the canticle, but those hundred forty-four thousand, who were purchased from the earth.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=73&amp;ch=14&amp;l=4-#x">
                [4]

               These are they who were not defiled with women: for they are virgins. These follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were purchased from among men, the firstfruits to God and to the Lamb:

               And I saw another angel flying through the midst of heaven, having the eternal gospel, to preach unto them that sit upon the earth, and over every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=73&amp;ch=14&amp;l=7-#x">

               Saying with a loud voice: Fear the Lord, and give him honour, because the hour of his judgment is come; and adore ye him, that made heaven and earth, the sea, and the fountains of waters.
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=73&amp;ch=14&amp;l=8-#x">
                [8]

               And another angel followed, saying: That great
               <u>
                Babylon
               </u>
               is fallen, is fallen; which made all nations to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.

                [9]
               </a>
               And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice: If any man shall adore the beast and his image, and receive his character in his forehead, or in his hand;
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=73&amp;ch=14&amp;l=10-#x">
                [10]
               </a>
               He also shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mingled with pure wine in the cup of his wrath, and shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the sight of the holy angels, and in the sight of the Lamb.

It may also be some city of the description in the text, that will exist, and be destroyed, as here described, towards the end of the world.

               And the angel thrust in his sharp sickle into the earth, and gathered the vineyard of the earth, and cast it into the great press of the wrath of God:
               <a href="/x/d?b=drb&amp;bk=73&amp;ch=14&amp;l=20-#x">
                [20]
               </a>
               And the press was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the press, up to the horses' bridles, for a thousand and six hundred furlongs.

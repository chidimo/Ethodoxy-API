{"1 Corinthians__06": {"7__A fault": ": Lawsuits can hardly ever be without a fault, on the one side or the other; and oftentimes on both sides.", "12__All things are lawful": ": That is, all indifferent things are indeed lawful, inasmuch as they are not prohibited; but oftentimes they are not expedient; as in the case of lawsuits, etc. And much less would it be expedient to be enslaved by an irregular affection to any thing, how indifferent soever."}}

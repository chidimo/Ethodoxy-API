{"1 Corinthians__09": {"5__A woman, a sister": ": Some erroneous translators have corrupted this text by rendering it, a sister, a wife: whereas, it is certain, St. Paul had no wife (chap. 7 ver. 7, 8) and that he only speaks of such devout women, as, according to the custom of the Jewish nation, waited upon the preachers of the gospel, and supplied them with necessaries.", "16__It is no glory": ": That is, I have nothing to glory of.", "27__I chastise": ": Here St. Paul shews the necessity of self-denial and mortification, to subdue the flesh, and its inordinate desires."}}

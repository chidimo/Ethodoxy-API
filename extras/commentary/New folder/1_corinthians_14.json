{"1 Corinthians__14": {"1__Prophesy": ": That is, declare or expound the mysteries of faith.", "2__Not unto men": ": Viz., so as to be heard, that is, so as to be understood by them.", "12__Of spirits": ": Of spiritual gifts.", "16__Amen": ": The unlearned, not knowing that you are then blessing, will not be qualified to join with you by saying Amen to your blessing. The use or abuse of strange tongues, of which the apostle here speaks, does not regard the public liturgy of the church, (in which strange tongues were never used,) but certain conferences of the faithful, ver. 26, etc., in which, meeting together, they discovered to one another their various miraculous gifts of the Spirit, common in those primitive times; amongst which the apostle prefers that of prophesying before that of speaking strange tongues, because it was more to the public edification. Where also not, that the Latin, used in our liturgy, is so far from being a strange or unknown tongue, that it is perhaps the best known tongue in the world."}}

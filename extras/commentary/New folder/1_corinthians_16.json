{"1 Corinthians__16": {"22__Let him be anathema, maranatha": ": Anathema signifies here a thing accursed. Maran-atha, which, according to St. Jerome and St. Chrysostom, signify, 'The Lord is come' already, and therefore is to be taken as an admonition to those who doubted of the resurrection, and to put them in mind that Christ, the judge of the living and the dead, is come already. Others explain Maran-atha: 'May our Lord come', that is, to judge and punish those with exemplary judgments and punishments, that do not love the Lord Jesus Christ."}}

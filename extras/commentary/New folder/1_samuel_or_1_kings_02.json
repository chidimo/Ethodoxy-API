{"1 Samuel or 1 Kings__02": {"1__My horn": ": The horn in the scriptures signifies strength, power, the horn is said to be exalted, when a person receives an increase of strength or glory.", "25__Who shall pray for him": ": By this word Heli would have his sons understand, that by their wicked abuse of sacred things, and of the very sacrifices which were appointed to appease the Lord, they deprived themselves of the ordinary means of reconciliation with God; which was by sacrifices. The more, because they were the chief priests whose business it was to intercede for all others, they had no other to offer sacrifices and to make atonement for them. Ibid.", "25__Because the Lord would slay them": ": In consequence of their manifold sacrileges, he would not soften their hearts with his efficacious grace, but was determined to destroy them.", "32__Thy rival": ": A priest of another race. This was partly fulfilled, when Abiathar, of the race of Heli, was removed from the priesthood, and Sadoc, who was of another line, was substituted in his place. But it was more fully accomplished in the New Testament, when the priesthood of Aaron gave place to that of Christ."}}

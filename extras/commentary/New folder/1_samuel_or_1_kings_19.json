{"1 Samuel or 1 Kings__19": {"18__Najoth": ": It was probably a school or college of prophets, in or near Ramath under the direction of Samuel.", "20__Prophesying": ": That is, singing praises to God by a divine impulse. God was pleased on this occasion that both Samuel's messengers and himself should experience the like impulse, that he might understand, by this instance of the divine power, how vain are the designs of man against him whom God protects."}}

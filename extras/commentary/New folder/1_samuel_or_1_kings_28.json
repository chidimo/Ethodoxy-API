{"1 Samuel or 1 Kings__28": {"14__Understood that it was Samuel": ": It is the more common opinion of the holy fathers, and interpreters, that the soul of Samuel appeared indeed: and not, as some have imagined, an evil spirit in his shape. Not that the power of her magic could bring him thither, but that God was pleased for the punishment of Saul, that Samuel himself should denounce unto him the evils that were falling upon him. See Eccli. 46. 23.", "19__With me": ": That is, in the state of the dead, and in another world, though not in the same place."}}

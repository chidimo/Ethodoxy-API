{"2 Kings or 4 Kings__08": {"10__Tell him: thou shalt recover": ": By these words the prophet signified that the king's disease was not mortal: and that he would recover if no violence were used. Or he might only express himself in this manner, by way of giving Hazael to understand that he knew both what he would say and do; that he would indeed tell the king he should recover; but would be himself the instrument of his death.", "16__And of Josaphat": ": That is, Josaphat being yet alive, who sometime before his death made his son Joram king, as David had done before by his own son Solomon.", "26__Daughter": ": That is, grand-daughter; for she was daughter of Achab son of Amri, ver. 18."}}

{"2 Samuel or 2 Kings__23": {"4__As the light": ": So shall be the kingdom of Christ.", "5__Neither is my house": ": As if he should say: This everlasting covenant was not due to my house: but purely owing to his bounty; who is all my salvation, and my will: that is, who hath always saved me, and granted me what I beseeched of him; so that I and my house, through his blessing, have sprung up, and succeeded in all things.", "8__Jesbaham": ": The son of Hachamoni. For this was the name of this hero, as appears from 1 Chron. or Paralip. 11.-- Ibid.", "8__Most tender": ": He appeared like one tender and weak, but was indeed most valiant and strong. It seems the Latin has here given the interpretation of the Hebrew name of the hero, to whom Jesbaham was like, instead of the name itself, which was Adino the Eznite, one much renowned of old for his valour.", "9__Dodo": ": In Latin, Patrui ejus, which is the interpretation of the Hebrew name Dodo. The same occurs in ver. 24."}}

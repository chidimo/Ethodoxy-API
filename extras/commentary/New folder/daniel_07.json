{"Daniel__07": {"3__Four great beasts": ": Viz., the Chaldean, Persian, Grecian, and Roman empires. But some rather choose to understand the fourth beast of the successors of Alexander the Great, more especially of them that reigned in Asia and Syria.", "7__Ten horns": ": That is, ten kingdoms, (as Apoc. 17. 12,) among which the empire of the fourth beast shall be parcelled. Or ten kings of the number of the successors of Alexander; as figures of such as shall be about the time of Antichrist.", "8__Another little horn": ": This is commonly understood of Antichrist. It may also be applied to that great persecutor Antiochus Epiphanes, as a figure of Antichrist.", "25__A time, and times, and half a time": ": That is, three years and a half; which is supposed to be the length of the duration of the persecution of Antichrist."}}

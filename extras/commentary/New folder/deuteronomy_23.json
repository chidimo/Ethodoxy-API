{"Deuteronomy__23": {"1__Eunuch": ": By these are meant, in the spiritual sense, such as are barren in good works. Ibid.", "1__Into the church": ": That is, into the assembly or congregation of Israel, so as to have the privilege of an Israelite, or to be capable of any place or office among the people of God.", "14__No uncleanness": ": This caution against suffering any filth in the camp, was to teach them to fly the filth of sin, which driveth God away from the soul.", "20__To the stranger": ": This was a dispensation granted by God to his people, who being the Lord of all things, can give a right and title to one upon the goods of another. Otherwise the scripture everywhere condemns usury, as contrary to the law of God, and a crying sin. See Ex. 22. 25; Lev. 25. 36, 37; 2 Esd. 5. 7; Ps. 14. 5; Ezech. 18. 8, 13, etc."}}

{"Ezeckiel or Ezechiel__38": {"2__Gog": ": This name, which signifies hidden or covered, is taken in this place, either for the persecutors of the church of God in general, or some arch-persecutor in particular: such as Antichrist shall be in the latter days. See Apoc. 20. 8. And what is said of the punishment of Gog, is verified by the unhappy ends of persecutors.-- Ibid.", "2__Magog": ": Scythia or Tartary, from whence the Turks, and other enemies of the church of Christ, originally sprung."}}

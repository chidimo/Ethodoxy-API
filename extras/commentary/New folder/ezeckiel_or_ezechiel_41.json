{"Ezeckiel or Ezechiel__41": {"1__The temple": ": This plan of a temple, which was here shewn to the prophet in a vision, partly had relation to the material temple, which was to be rebuilt: and partly, in a mystical sense, to the spiritual temple of God, the church of Christ.", "6__One by another": ": Or one over another; literally, side to side, or side upon side.", "9__And the inner house was within the side chambers of the house": ": Because these side chambers were in the very walls of the temple all round. Or, it may also be rendered (more agreeably to the Hebrew) so as to signify that the thickness of the wall for the side chamber within, was the same as that of the wall without; that is, equally five cubits.", "21__The threshold was foursquare": ": That is, the gate of the temple was foursquare: and so placed as to answer the gate of the sanctuary within."}}

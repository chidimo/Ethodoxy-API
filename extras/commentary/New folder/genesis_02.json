Though, as our Lord tells us, John 5. 17,\"He still worketh\", viz., by conserving and governing all things, and creating souls.", "9__The tree of life": ": So called because it had that quality, that by eating of the fruit of it, man would have been preserved in a constant state of health, vigour, and strength, and would not have died at all.", "9__The tree of knowledge": ": To which the deceitful serpent falsely attributed the power of imparting a superior kind of knowledge, beyond that which God was pleased to give."}}

{"Genesis__10": {"5__The islands": ": So the Hebrews called all the remote countries, to which they went by ships from Judea, to Greece, Italy, Spain, etc.", "9__A stout hunter": ": Not of beasts but of men: whom by violence and tyranny he brought under his dominion. And such he was, not only in the opinion of men, but before the Lord, that is, in his sight who cannot be deceived."}}

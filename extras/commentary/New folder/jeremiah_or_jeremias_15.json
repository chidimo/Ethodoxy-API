{"Jeremiah or Jeremias__15": {"12__Shall iron be allied": ": Shall the iron, that is, the strength of Juda, stand against the stronger iron of the north, that is, of Babylon: or enter into an alliance upon equal footing with it? No certainly: but it must be broken by it.", "15__Do not defend me in thy patience": ": That is, let not thy patience and longsuffering, which thou usest towards sinners, keep thee from making haste to my assistance."}}

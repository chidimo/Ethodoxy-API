{"Jeremiah or Jeremias__23": {"34__Burden of the Lord": ": This expression is here rejected and disallowed, at least for those times: because it was then used in mockery and contempt by the false prophets, and unbelieving people, who ridiculed the repeated threats of Jeremias under the name of his burdens.", "39__Out of my presence": ": That is, the Lord declares that out of his presence he will cast them, and bring them to captivity for their transgressions."}}

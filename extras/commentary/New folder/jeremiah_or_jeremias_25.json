{"Jeremiah or Jeremias__25": {"9__My servant": ": So this wicked king is here called; because God made him his instrument in punishing the sins of his people.", "12__Punish": ": Literally, visit upon.", "26__Sesac": ": That is, Babel, or Babylon; which after bringing all these people under her yoke, should quickly fall and be destroyed herself.", "38__The dove": ": This is commonly understood of Nabuchodonosor, whose military standard, it is said, was a dove. But the Hebrew word Jonah, which is here rendered a dove, may also signify a waster or oppressor, which name better agrees to that unmerciful prince; or by comparison, as a dove's flight is the swiftest, so would their destruction come upon them."}}

{"Job__36": {"16__Out of the narrow mouth": ": That is, out of hell, whose entrance is narrow, and its depth bottomless; but figuratively meant here, that is, from his miseries and calamity to be restored to his former state of happiness.", "21__For this thou hast begun to follow after misery": ": Eliu charges Job, that notwithstanding his misery, he does not fear God as he ought: but in his judgment, falls into iniquity."}}

{"Luke__07": {"29__Justified God": ": that is, praised the justice of God, feared and worshipped God, as just and merciful.", "36__One of the Pharisees": ": that is, Simon.", "47__Many sins are forgiven her, because she hath loved much": ": In the scripture an effect sometimes seems attributed to one only cause, when there are divers other concurring dispositions; for the sins of this woman, in this verse, are said to be forgiven, because she loved much: but (ver. 50) Christ tells her, Thy faith hath made thee safe. Hence in a true conversion are joined faith, hope, love, sorrow for sin, and other pious dispositions."}}

{"Luke__16": {"9__Mammon of iniquity": ": Mammon signifies riches. They are here called the mammon of iniquity, because oftentimes ill gotten, ill bestowed, or an occasion of evil; and at the best are but worldly, and false; and not the true riches of a Christian.", "9__They may receive": ": By this we see, that the poor servants of God, whom we have relieved by our alms, may hereafter, by their intercession, bring our souls to heaven.", "22__Abraham's bosom": ": The place of rest, where the souls of the saints resided, till Christ had opened heaven by his death."}}

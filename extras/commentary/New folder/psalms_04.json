{"Psalms__04": {"1__Unto the end": ": Or, as St. Jerome renders it, victori, to him that overcometh: which some understand of the chief musician; to whom they suppose the psalms, which bear that title, were given to be sung: we rather understand the psalms thus inscribed to refer to Christ, who is the end of the law, and the great conqueror of death and hell, and to the New Testament.-- Ibid.", "1__In verses": ": in carminibus. In the Hebrew, it is neghinoth, supposed by some to be a musical instrument, with which this psalm was to be sung.-- Ibid.", "1__For David": ": That is, inspired to David himself, or to be sung."}}

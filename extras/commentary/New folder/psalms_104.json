{"Psalms__104": {"25__He turned their heart": ": Not that God (who is never the author of sin) moved the Egyptians to hate and persecute his people; but that the Egyptians took occasion of hating and envying them, from the sight of the benefits which God bestowed upon them.", "28__Grieved not his words": ": That is, he was not wanting to fulfil his words: or he did not grieve Moses and Aaron, the carriers of his words: or he did not grieve his words, that is, his sons, the children of Israel, who enjoyed light whilst the Egyptians were oppressed with darkness.", "31__Sciniphs": ": See the annotation, Ex. 8. 16.", "34__Bruchus": ": An insect of the locust kind.", "45__His justifications": ": That is, his commandments; which here, and in many other places of the scripture, are called justifications, because the keeping of them makes man just. The Protestants render it by the word statutes, in favour of their doctrine, which does not allow good works to justify."}}

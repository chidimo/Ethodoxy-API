{"Psalms__93": {"13__Rest from the evil days": ": That thou mayst mitigate the sorrows, to which he is exposed, during the short and evil days of his mortality.", "15__Until justice be turned into judgment": ": By being put in execution; which will be agreeable to all the upright in heart.", "20__Doth the seat of iniquity stick to thee": ": That is, wilt thou, O God, who art always just, admit of the seat of iniquity: that is, of injustice, or unjust judges, to have any partnership with thee? Thou who framest, or makest, labour in commandment, that is, thou who obligest us to labour with all diligence to keep thy commandments."}}

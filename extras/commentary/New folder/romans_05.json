{"Romans__05": {"12__By one man": ": Adam, from whom we all contracted original sin.", "13__Not imputed": ": That is, men knew not, or made no account of sin, neither was it imputed to them, in the manner it was afterwards, when they transgressed the known written law of God.", "20__That sin might abound": ": Not as if the law were given on purpose for sin to abound: but that it so happened through man's perversity, taking occasion of sinning more, from the prohibition of sin."}}

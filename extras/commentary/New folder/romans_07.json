{"Romans__07": {"1__As long as it liveth": ": or, as long as he liveth.", "8__Sin, taking occasion by the commandment": ": Sin, or concupiscence, which is called sin, because it is from sin, and leads to sin, which was asleep before, was weakened by the prohibition: the law not being the cause thereof, nor properly giving occasion to it: but occasion being taken by our corrupt nature to resist the commandment laid upon us.", "13__That it may appear sin": ": viz. To be the monster it is, which is even capable to take occasion from that which is good, to work death.", "15__I do not that good which I will": ": The apostle here describes the disorderly motions of passion and concupiscence; which oftentimes in us get the start of reason: and by means of which even good men suffer in the inferior appetite what their will abhors: and are much hindered in the accomplishment of the desires of their spirit and mind. But these evil motions, (though they are called the law of sin, because they come from original sin, and violently tempt and incline to sin,) as long as the will does not consent to them, are not sins, because they are not voluntary."}}

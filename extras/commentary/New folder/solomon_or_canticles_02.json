{"Solomon or Canticles__02": {"1__I am the flower of the field": ": Christ professes himself the flower of mankind, yea, the Lord of all creatures: and, ver. 2, declares the excellence of his spouse, the true church above all other societies, which are to be considered as thorns.", "8__The voice of my beloved": ": that is, the preaching of the gospel surmounting difficulties figuratively here expressed by mountains and little hills.", "15__Catch us the little foxes": ": Christ commands his pastors to catch false teachers, by holding forth their fallacy and erroneous doctrine, which like foxes would bite and destroy the vines."}}

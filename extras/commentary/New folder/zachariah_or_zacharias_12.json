{"Zachariah or Zacharias__12": {"2__A lintel of surfeiting": ": That is, a door into which they shall seek to enter, to glut themselves with blood; but they shall stumble, and fall like men stupefied with wine. It seems to allude to the times of Antiochus, and to the victories of the Machabees.", "11__Adadremmon": ": A place near Mageddon, where the good king Josias was slain, and much lamented by his people."}}

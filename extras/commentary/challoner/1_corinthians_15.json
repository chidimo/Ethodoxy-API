{"1 Corinthians__15": {"28__The Son also himself shall be subject unto him": "That is, the Son will be subject to the Father, according to his human nature, even after the general resurrection; and also the whole mystical body of Christ will be entirely subject to God, obeying him in every thing.", "29__That are baptized for the dead": "Some think the apostle here alludes to a ceremony then in use; but others, more probably, to the prayers and penitential labours, performed by the primitive Christians for the souls of the faithful departed; or to the baptism of afflictions and sufferings undergone for sinners spiritually dead.", "32__Let us eat and drink": "That is, if we did not believe that we were to rise again from the dead, we might live like the impious and wicked, who have no belief in the resurrection."}}

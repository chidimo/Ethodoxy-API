{"1 Samuel or 1 Kings__24": {"6__Heart struck him": "Viz., with remorse, as fearing he had done amiss.", "11__A thought to kill thee": "That is, a suggestion, to which I did not consent.", "13__Revenge me of thee": "Or, as it is in the Hebrew, will revenge me. The meaning is, that he refers his whole cause to God, to judge and punish according to his justiceyet so as to keep himself in the mean time, from all personal hatred to Saul, or desire of gratifying his own passion, by seeking revenge. So far from it, that when Saul was afterwards slain, we find, that instead of rejoicing at his death, he mourned most bitterly for him."}}

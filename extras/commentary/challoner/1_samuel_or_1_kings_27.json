{"1 Samuel or 1 Kings__27": {"8__Pillaged Gessuri": "These probably were enemies of the people of Godand some, if not all of them, were of the number of those whom God had ordered to be destroyedwhich justifies David's proceedings in their regard. Though it is to be observed here, that we are not under an obligation of justifying every thing that he didfor the scripture, in relating what was done, does not say that it was well done. And even such as are true servants of God, are not to be imitated in all they do."}}

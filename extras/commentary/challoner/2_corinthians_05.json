{"2 Corinthians__05": {"10__The proper things of the body": "In the particular judgment, immediately after death, the soul is rewarded or punished according to what it has done in the body.", "16__We know no man according to the flesh": "That is, we consider not any man with regard to his nation, family, kindred, or other natural qualities or advantages; but only with relation to Christ, and according to the order of divine charity, in God, and for God. The apostle adds, that even with respect to Christ himself, he now no longer considers him according to the flesh, by taking a satisfaction in his being his countryman; his affection being now purified from all such earthly considerations.", "21__Sin for us": "That is, to be a sin offering, a victim for sin."}}

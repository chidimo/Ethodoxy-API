{"2 Corinthians__11": {"1__My folly": "So he calls his reciting his own praises, which, commonly speaking is looked upon as a piece of folly and vanity; though the apostle was constrained to do it, for the good of the souls committed to his charge.", "28__My daily instance": "The labours that come in, and press upon me every day."}}

{"Apocalypse / Revelation__01": {"1__Things which must shortly come to pass": "and again it is said, ver. 3, The time is at hand-- This cannot be meant of all the things prophesied in the Apocalypse, where mention is made also of the day of judgment, and of the glory of heaven at the end of the world. That some things were to come to pass shortly, is evident, by what is said to the Seven Churches, chap. 2 and 3, Or that the persecutions foretold should begin shortly. Or that these words signified, that all time is short, and that from the coming of Christ, we are now in the last age or last hour. See 1 John 2. 18.", "8__I am Alpha and Omega": "These are the names of the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, and signify the same as what followsThe beginning and the endthe first cause and last end of all beingswho is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty-- These words signify the true God only, and are here applied to our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, who is to come again to judge the living and the dead."}}

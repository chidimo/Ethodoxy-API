{"Apocalypse / Revelation__06": {"2__White horse": "He that sitteth on the white horse is Christ, going forth to subdue the world by his gospel. The other horses that follow represent the judgments and punishment that were to fall on the enemies of Christ and his church. The red horse signifies war; the black horse, famine; and the pale horse (which has Death for its rider), plagues or pestilence.", "9__Under the altar": "Christ, as man, is this altar, under which the souls of the martyrs live in heaven, as their bodies are here deposited under our altars.", "10__Revenge our blood": "They ask not this out of hatred to their enemies, but out of zeal for the glory of God, and a desire that the Lord would accelerate the general judgment, and the complete beatitude of all his elect."}}

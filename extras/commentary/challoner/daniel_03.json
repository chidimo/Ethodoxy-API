{"Daniel__03": {"24__And they walked": "Here St. Jerome takes notice, that from this verse, to ver. 91, was not in the Hebrew in his time. But as it was in all the Greek Bibles, (which were originally translated from the Hebrew,) it is more than probable that it had been formerly in the Hebrew or rather in the Chaldaic, in which the book of Daniel was written. But this is certainthat it is, and has been of old, received by the church, and read as canonical scripture in her liturgy, and divine offices.", "98__Nabuchodonosor": "These last three verses are a kind of preface to the following chapter, which is written in the style of an epistle from the king."}}

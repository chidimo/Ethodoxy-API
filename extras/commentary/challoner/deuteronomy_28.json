{"Deuteronomy__28": {"2__All these blessings": "In the Old Testament, God promised temporal blessings to the keepers of his law, heaven not being opened as yet; and that gross and sensual people being more moved with present and sensible things. But in the New Testament the goods that are promised us are spiritual and eternal; and temporal evils are turned into blessings.", "15__All these curses": "Thus God dealt with the transgressors of his law in the Old Testamentbut now he often suffers sinners to prosper in this world, rewarding them for some little good they have done, and reserving their punishment for the other world."}}

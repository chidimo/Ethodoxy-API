{"Ecclesiastes__03": {"19__Man hath nothing more": "Viz., as to the life of the body.", "21__Who knoweth": "Viz., experimentallysince no one in this life can see a spirit. But as to the spirit of the beasts, which is merely animal, and become extinct by the death of the beast, who can tell the manner it acts so as to give life and motion, and by death to descend downward, that is, to be no more?"}}

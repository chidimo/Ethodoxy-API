{"Exodus__33": {"11__Face to face": "That is, in a most familiar manner. Though as we learn from this very chapter, Moses could not see the face of the Lord.", "12__I know thee by name": "In the language of the scriptures, God is said to know such as he approves and lovesand to know by name, those whom he favours in a most singular manner, as he did his servant Moses.", "23__See my back parts": "The Lord by his angel, usually spoke to Moses in the pillar of the cloud; so that he could not see the glory of him that spoke familiarly with him. In the vision here mentioned he was allowed to see something of him, in an assumed corporeal formnot in the face, the rays of which were too bright for mortal eye to bear, but to view him as it were behind, when his face was turned from him."}}

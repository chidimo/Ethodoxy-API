{"Ezeckiel or Ezechiel__11": {"3__Were not houses lately built": "These men despised the predictions and threats of the prophets; who declared to them from God, that the city should be destroyed, and the inhabitants carried into captivityand they made use of this kind of argument against the prophets, that the city, so far from being like to be destroyed, had lately been augmented by the building of new houses; from whence they further inferred, by way of a proverb, using the similitude of a cauldron, out of which the flesh is not taken, till it is thoroughly boiled, and fit to be eaten, that they should not be carried away out of their city, but there end their days in peace.", "10__In the borders of Israel": "They pretended that they should die in peace in Jerusalem; God tells them it should not be so; but that they should be judged and condemned, and fall by the sword in the borders of Israelviz., in Reblatha in the land of Emath, where all their chief men were put to death by Nabuchodonosor. 4 Kings 25., and Jer. 52. 10, 27.", "15__Thy brethren": "He speaks of them that had been carried away captives before; who were despised by them that remained in Jerusalembut as the prophet here declares to them from God, should be in a more happy condition than they, and after some time return from their captivity."}}

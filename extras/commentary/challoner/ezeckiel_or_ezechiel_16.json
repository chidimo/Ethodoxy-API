For pride, gluttony, and idleness are the highroad to all kinds of lust; especially when they are accompanied with a neglect of the works of mercy.", "53__I will bring back": "This relates to the conversion of the Gentiles out of all nations, and of many of the Jews, to the church of Christ.", "55__Ancient state": "That is, to their former state of liberty, and their ancient possessions.

{"Genesis__09": {"21__Drunk": "Noe by the judgment of the fathers was not guilty of sin, in being overcome by winebecause he knew not the strength of it.", "23__Covered the nakedness": "Thus, as St. Gregory takes notice L. 35; Moral. c. 22, we ought to cover the nakedness, that is, the sins, of our spiritual parents and superiors.", "25__Cursed be Chanaan": "The curses, as well as the blessings, of the patriarchs, were propheticalAnd this in particular is here recorded by Moses, for the children of Israel, who were to possess the land of Chanaan. But why should Chanaan be cursed for his father's faults? The Hebrews answer, that he being then a boy, was the first that saw his grandfather's nakedness, and told his father Cham of it; and joined with him in laughing at itwhich drew upon him, rather than upon the rest of the children of Cham, this prophetical curse."}}

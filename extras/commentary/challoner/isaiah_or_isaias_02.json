{"Isaiah or Isaias__02": {"2__The last days": "The whole time of the new law, from the coming of Christ till the end of the world, is called in the scripture the last days; because no other age or time shall come after it, but only eternity.-- Ibid.", "2__On the top of mountains": "This shews the perpetual visibility of the church of Christfor a mountain upon the top of mountains cannot be hid.", "18__Idols shall be utterly destroyed": "or utterly pass away. This was verified by the establishment of Christianity. And by this and other texts of the like nature, the wild system of some modern sectaries is abundantly confuted, who charge the whole Christian church with worshipping idols, for many ages."}}

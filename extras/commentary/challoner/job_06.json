{"Job__06": {"2__My sins": "He does not mean to compare his sufferings with his real sinsbut with the imaginary crimes which his friends imputed to himand especially with his wrath, or grief, expressed in the third chapter, which they so much accused. Though, as he tells them here, it bore no proportion with the greatness of his calamity."}}

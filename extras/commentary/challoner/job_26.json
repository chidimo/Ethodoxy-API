{"Job__26": {"13__His obstetric hand brought forth the winding serpent": "That is, the omnipotent power of Godwhich brought forth all things created in time, but conceived in the Divine mind from all eternity. The winding serpent, a constellation of fixed stars winding round the north pole, called Draco. This appears from the foregoing part of the same verse, His spirit hath adorned the heavens."}}

{"John__02": {"4__What is that to me": "These words of our Saviour, spoken to his mother, have been understood by some commentators as harsh, they not considering the next following verseWhatsoever he shall say to you, do ye, which plainly shews that his mother knew of the miracle that he was to perform, and that it was at her request he wrought it; besides the manner of speaking the words as to the tone, and the countenance shewn at the same time, which could only be known to those who were present, or from what had followedfor words indicating anger in one tone of voice, would be understood quite the reverse in another."}}

{"John__09": {"39__I am come": "Not that Christ came for that end, that any one should be made blindbut that the Jews, by the abuse of his coming, and by their not receiving him, brought upon themselves this judgment of blindness.", "41__If you were blind": "If you were invincibly ignorant, and had neither read the scriptures, nor seen my miracles, you would not be guilty of the sin of infidelitybut now, as you boast of your knowledge of the scriptures, you are inexcusable."}}

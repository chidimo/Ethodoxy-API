{"John__16": {"8__He will convict the world of sin": "The Holy Ghost, by his coming brought over many thousands, first, to a sense of their sin in not believing in Christ. Secondly, to a conviction of the justice of Christ, now sitting at the right hand of his Father. And thirdly, to a right apprehension of the judgment prepared for them that choose to follow Satan, who is already judged and condemned.", "13__Will teach you all truth": "See the annotation on chap. 14. ver. 26."}}

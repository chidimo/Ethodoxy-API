{"Judges__05": {"6__The paths rested": "The ways to the sanctuary of God were unfrequentedand men walked in the by-ways of error and sin.", "14__Out of Ephraim": "The enemies straggling in their flight were destroyed, as they were running through the land of Ephraim, and of Benjamin, which lies after, that is beyond Ephraimand so on to the very confines of Amalec. Or, it alludes to former victories of the people of God, particularly that which was freshest in memory, when the men of Ephraim and Benjamin, with Aod at their head, overthrew their enemies the Moabites with the Amalecites their allies. See chap. 3.-- Ibid.", "14__Machir": "The tribe of Manasses, whose eldest son was Machir.", "15__Divided against himself": "By this it seems that the valient men of the tribe of Ruben were divided in their sentiments, with relation to this war; which division kept them at home within their own borders, to hear the bleating of their flocks.", "23__Meroz": "Where this land of Meroz was, which is here laid under a curse, we cannot findnor is there mention of it anywhere else in holy writ. In the spiritual sense, they are cursed who refuse to assist the people of God in their warfare against their spiritual enemies."}}

{"Luke__07": {"29__Justified God": "that is, praised the justice of God, feared and worshipped God, as just and merciful.", "36__One of the Pharisees": "that is, Simon.", "47__Many sins are forgiven her, because she hath loved much": "In the scripture an effect sometimes seems attributed to one only cause, when there are divers other concurring dispositions; for the sins of this woman, in this verse, are said to be forgiven, because she loved muchbut (ver. 50) Christ tells her, Thy faith hath made thee safe. Hence in a true conversion are joined faith, hope, love, sorrow for sin, and other pious dispositions."}}

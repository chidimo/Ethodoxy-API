{"Malachi or Malachias__01": {"2__I have loved Jacob": "I have preferred his posterity, to make them my chosen people, and to lead them with my blessings, without any merit on their part, and though they have been always ungrateful; whilst I have rejected Esau, and executed severe judgments upon his posterity. Not that God punished Esau, or his posterity, beyond their desertbut that by his free election and grace he loved Jacob, and favoured his posterity above their deserts. See the annotations upon Rom. 9.", "11__A clean oblation": "Viz., the precious body and blood of Christ in the eucharistic sacrifice.", "13__Behold of our labour": "You pretended labour and weariness, when you brought your offering; and so made it of no value, by offering it with an evil mind. Moreover, what you offered was both defective in itself, and gotten by rapine and extortion."}}

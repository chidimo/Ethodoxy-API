{"Mark__14": {"1__Azymes": "That is, the feast of the unleavened bread.", "30__Crow twice": "The cocks crow at two different times of the night; viz., about midnight for the first time; and then about the time commonly called the cock crowing; and this was the cock crowing our Saviour spoke of; and therefore the other Evangelists take no notice of the first crowing."}}

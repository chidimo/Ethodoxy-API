{"Matthew__10": {"16__Simple": "That is, harmless, plain, sincere, and without guile.", "35__I came to set a man at variance": "Not that this was the end or design of the coming of our Saviour; but that his coming and his doctrine would have this effect, by reason of the obstinate resistance that many would make, and of their persecuting all such as should adhere to him."}}

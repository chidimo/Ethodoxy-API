{"Numbers__18": {"1__And thy father's house with thee, shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary": "That is, you shall be punished if, through negligence or want of due attention, you err in the discharge of the sacred functions for which you were ordained.", "19__A covenant of salt": "It is a proverbial expression, signifying a covenant not to be altered or corrupted; as salt is used to keep things from corruption; a covenant perpetual, like that by which it was appointed, that salt should be used in every sacrifice. Lev. 2.", "22__Deadly sin": "That is, sin which will bring death after it."}}

{"Psalms__138": {"4__There is no speech": "Viz., unknown to theeor when there is no speech in my tongue; yet my whole interior and my most secret thoughts are known to thee.", "20__Because you say in thought": "Depart from me, you wicked, who plot against the servants of God, and think to cast them out of the cities of their habitation; as if they have received them in vain, and to no purpose.", "22__I have hated them": "Not with an hatred of malice, but a zeal for the observance of God's commandments; which he saw were despised by the wicked, who are to be considered enemies to God."}}

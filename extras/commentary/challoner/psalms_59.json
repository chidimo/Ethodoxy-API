{"Psalms__59": {"10__The pot of my hope": "Or my watering pot. That is, a vessel for meaner uses, by being reduced to serve me, even in the meanest employments.-- Ibid.", "10__Foreigners": "So the Philistines are called, who had no kindred with the Israelites; whereas the Edomites, Moabites, etc., were originally of the same family."}}

{"Psalms__63": {"7__A deep heart": "That is, crafty, subtle, deep projects and designs; which nevertheless shall not succeed; for God shall be exalted in bringing them to nought by his wisdom and power.", "8__The arrows of children are their wounds": "That is, the wounds, stripes, or blows, they seek to inflict upon the just, are but like the weak efforts of children's arrows, which can do no executionand their tongues, that is, their speeches against them come to nothing."}}

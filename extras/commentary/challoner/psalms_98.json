{"Psalms__98": {"1__Let the people be angry": "Though many enemies rage, and the whole earth be stirred up to oppose the reign of Christ, he shall still prevail.", "4__Loveth judgment": "Requireth discretion.-- Ibid.", "4__Directions": "Most right and just laws to direct men.", "5__Adore his footstool": "The ark of the covenant was called, in the Old Testament, God's footstoolover which he was understood to sit, on his propitiatory, or mercy seat, as on a throne, between the wings of the cherubims, in the sanctuaryto which the children of Israel paid a great veneration. But as this psalm evidently relates to Christ, and the New Testament, where the ark has no place, the holy fathers understand this text, of the worship paid by the church to the body and blood of Christ in the sacred mysteriesinasmuch as the humanity of Christ is, as it were, the footstool of the divinity. So St. Ambrose, L. 3. De Spiritu Sancto, c. 12. And St. Augustine upon this psalm.", "6__Moses and Aaron among his priests": "By this it is evident, that Moses also was a priest, and indeed the chief priest, inasmuch as he consecrated Aaron, and offered sacrifice for him. Lev. 8. So that his pre-eminence over Aaron makes nothing for lay church headship.", "8__All their inventions": "that is, all the enterprises of their enemies against them, as in the case of Core, Dathan, and Abiron."}}

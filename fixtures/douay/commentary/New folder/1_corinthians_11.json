{"1 Corinthians__11": {"10__A power": ": that is, a veil or covering, as a sign that she is under the power of her husband: and this, the apostle adds, because of the angels, who are present in the assemblies of the faithful.", "19__There must be also heresies": ": By reason of the pride and perversity of man's heart; not by God's will or appointment; who nevertheless draws good out of this evil, manifesting, by that occasion, who are the good and firm Christians, and making their faith more remarkable.", "20__The Lord's supper": ": So the apostle here calls the charity feasts observed by the primitive Christians; and reprehends the abuses of the Corinthians, on these occasions; which were the more criminal, because these feasts were accompanied with the celebrating of the eucharistic sacrifice and sacrament.", "27__Or drink": ": Here erroneous translators corrupted the text, by putting and drink (contrary to the original) instead of or drink.", "27__Guilty of the body": ": not discerning the body. This demonstrates the real presence of the body and blood of Christ, even to the unworthy communicant; who otherwise could not be guilty of the body and blood of Christ, or justly condemned for not discerning the Lord's body.", "28__Drink of the chalice": ": This is not said by way of command, but by way of allowance, viz., where and when it is agreeable to the practice and discipline of the church."}}

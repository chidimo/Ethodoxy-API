{"1 Peter__03": {"19__Spirits that were in prison": ": See here a proof of a third place, or middle state of souls: for these spirits in prison, to whom Christ went to preach, after his death, were not in heaven; nor yet in the hell of the damned: because heaven is no prison: and Christ did not go to preach to the damned.", "21__Whereunto baptism": ": Baptism is said to be of the like form with the water by which Noe was saved, because the one was a figure of the other.", "21__Not the putting away": ": As much as to say, that baptism has not its efficacy, in order to salvation, from its washing away any bodily filth or dirt; but from its purging the conscience from sin, when accompanied with suitable dispositions in the party, to answer the interrogations made at that time, with relation to faith, the renouncing of Satan with all his works; and the obedience to God's commandments."}}

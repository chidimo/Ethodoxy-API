{"2 Kings or 4 Kings__02": {"1__Heaven": ": By heaven here is meant the air, the lowest of the heavenly regions.", "3__The sons of the prophets": ": That is, the disciples of the prophets; who seem to have had their schools, like colleges or communities, in Bethel, Jericho, and other places in the days of Elias and Eliseus.", "9__Double spirit": ": A double portion of thy spirit, as the eldest son and heir: or thy spirit which is double in comparison of that which God usually imparteth to his prophets.", "15__They worshipped him": ": viz., with an inferior, yet religious veneration, not for any temporal, but spiritual excellency.", "24__Cursed them": ": This curse, which was followed by so visible a judgment of God, was not the effect of passion, or of a desire of revenging himself; but of zeal for religion, which was insulted by these boys, in the person of the prophet; and of a divine inspiration: God punishing in this manner the inhabitants of Bethel, (the chief seat of the calf worship,) who had trained up their children in a prejudice against the true religion and its ministers."}}

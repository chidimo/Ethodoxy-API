{"Acts of Apostles__07": {"45__Jesus": ": That is Josue, so called in Greek.", "48__Dwelleth not in houses": ": That is, so as to stand in need of earthly dwellings, or to be contained, or circumscribed by them. Though, otherwise by his immense divinity, he is in our houses; and every where else; and Christ in his humanity dwelt in houses; and is now on our altars."}}

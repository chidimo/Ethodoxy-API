{"Ecclesiasticus *__07": {"15__Repeat not": ": Make not much babbling by repetition of words: but aim more at fervour of heart.", "33__Thy arms": ": That is, with all thy power: or else by arms (brachiis) are here signified the right shoulders of the victims, which by the law fell to the priests. See ver. 35.", "37__And restrain not grace from the dead": ": That is, withhold not from them the benefit of alms, prayers, and sacrifices. Such was the doctrine and practice of the church of God even in the time of the Old Testament. And the same has always been continued from the days of the apostles in the church of the New Testament."}}

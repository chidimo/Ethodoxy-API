{"Exodus__03": {"2__The Lord appeared": ": That is, an angel representing God, and speaking in his name.", "14__I am who am": ": That is, I am being itself, eternal, self-existent, independent, infinite; without beginning, end, or change; and the source of all other beings.", "22__Shall spoil": ": That is, you shall strip, and take away the goods of the Egyptians. This was not authorizing theft or injustice; but was a just disposal made by Him, who is the great lord and master of all things, in order to pay the children of Israel some part of what was due to them from the Egyptians for their labours."}}

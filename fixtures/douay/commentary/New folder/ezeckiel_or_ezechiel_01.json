All this chapter appeared so obscure, and so full of mysteries to the ancient Hebrews, that, as we learn from St. Jerome, (Ep. ad Paulin.,) they suffered none to read it before they were thirty years old.", "17__When they went, they went by their four parts": ": That is, indifferently to any of their sides either forward or backward: to the right or to the left."}}

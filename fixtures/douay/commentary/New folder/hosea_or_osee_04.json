{"Hosea or Osee__04": {"4__Let not any man judge": ": As if he would say: It is in vain to strive with them, or reprove them, they are so obstinate in evil.", "15__Not into Galgal, and come not up into Bethaven": ": Places where idols were worshipped. Bethel, which signifies the house of God, is called by the prophet, Bethaven, that is, the house of vanity, from Jeroboam's golden calf that was worshipped there."}}

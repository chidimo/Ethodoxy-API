{"Hosea or Osee__11": {"1__I called my son": ": Viz., Israel. But as the calling of Israel out of Egypt, was a figure of the calling of Christ from thence; therefore this text is also applicable to Christ, as we learn from Matthew 2. 15.", "2__They called": ": Viz., Moses and Aaron called; but they went away after other gods and would not hear.", "8__Adama": ": Adama and Seboim were two cities in the neighbourhood of Sodom: and underwent the like destruction."}}

{"Isaiah or Isaias__08": {"19__Seek of pythons": ": That is, people pretending to tell future things by a prophesying spirit.-- Ibid.", "19__Should not the people seek of their God, for the living of the dead?": ": Here is signified, that it is to God we should pray to be directed, and not to seek of the dead, (that is, of fortune-tellers dead in sin,) for the health of the living."}}

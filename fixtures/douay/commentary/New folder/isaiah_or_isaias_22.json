{"Isaiah or Isaias__22": {"1__The valley of vision": ": Jerusalem. The temple of Jerusalem was built upon mount Moria, or the mountain of vision. But the city is here called the valley of vision; either because it was lower than the temple, or because of the low condition to which it was to be reduced."}}

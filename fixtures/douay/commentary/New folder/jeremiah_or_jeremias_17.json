{"Jeremiah or Jeremias__17": {"6__Tamaric": ": A barren shrub that grows in the driest parts of the wilderness.", "18__Let them be confounded": ": Such expressions as these in the writings of the prophets, are not to be understood as imprecations proceeding from malice or desire of revenge: but as prophetic predictions of evils that were about to fall upon impenitent sinners, and approbations of the ways of divine justice."}}

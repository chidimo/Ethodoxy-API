{"Micah or Micheas__05": {"1__Daughter of the robber": ": Some understand this of Babylon; which robbed and pillaged the temple of God: others understand it of Jerusalem; by reason of the many rapines and oppressions committed there.", "2__His going forth": ": That is, he who as man shall be born in thee, as God was born of his Father from all eternity.", "5__The Assyrian": ": That is, the persecutors of the church: who are here called Assyrians by the prophet: because the Assyrians were at that time the chief enemies and persecutors of the people of God.-- Ibid.", "5__Seven shepherds": ": Viz., the pastors of God's church, and the defenders of the faith. The number seven in scripture is taken to signify many: and when eight is joined with it, we are to understand that the number will be very great.", "6__They shall feed": ": They shall make spiritual conquests in the lands of their persecutors, with the word of the spirit, which is the word of God. Eph. 6. 17.", "7__The remnant of Jacob": ": Viz., the apostles, and the first preachers of the Jewish nation; whose doctrine, like dew, shall make the plants of the converted Gentiles grow up, without waiting for any man to cultivate them by human learning.", "8__As a lion": ": This denotes the fortitude of these first preachers; and their success in their spiritual enterprises.", "10__I will take away thy horses": ": Some understand this, and all that follows to the end of the chapter, as addressed to the enemies of the church. But it may as well be understood of the converts to the church: who should no longer put their trust in any of these things."}}

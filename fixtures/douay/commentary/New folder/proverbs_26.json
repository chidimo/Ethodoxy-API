{"Proverbs__26": {"2__As a bird": ": The meaning is, that a curse uttered without cause shall do no harm to the person that is cursed, but will return upon him that curseth, as whithersoever a bird flies, it returns to its own nest.", "4__Answer not a fool": ": Viz., so as to imitate him but only so as to reprove his folly."}}

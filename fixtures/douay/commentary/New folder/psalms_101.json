{"Psalms__101": {"7__A pelican": ": I am become through grief, like birds that affect solitude and darkness.", "24__He answered him in the way of his strength": ": That is, the people, mentioned in the foregoing verse, or the penitent, in whose person this psalm is delivered, answered the Lord in the way of his strength: that is, according to the best of his power and strength: or when he was in the flower of his age and strength: inquiring after the fewness of his days: to know if he should live long enough to see the happy restoration of Sion, etc."}}

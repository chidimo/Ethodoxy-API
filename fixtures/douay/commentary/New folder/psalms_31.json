{"Psalms__31": {"3__Because I was silent": ": That is, whilst I kept silence, by concealing, or refusing to confess my sins, thy hand was heavy upon me, etc.", "4__I am turned": ": That is, I turn and roll about in my bed to seek for ease in my pain whilst the thorn of thy justice pierces my flesh, and sticks fast in me. Or, I am turned: that is, I am converted to thee, my God, by being brought to a better understanding by thy chastisements. In the Hebrew it is, my moisture is turned into the droughts of the summer."}}

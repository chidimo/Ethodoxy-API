{"Psalms__48": {"6__The iniquity of my heel": ": That is, the iniquity of my steps or ways: or the iniquity of my pride, with which as with the heel, I have spurned and kicked at my neighbours: or the iniquity of my heel, that is, the iniquity in which I shall be found in death. The meaning of this verse is, Why should I now indulge those passions and sinful affections, or commit now those sins, which will cause me so much fear and anguish in the evil day; when the sorrows of death shall compass me, and the perils of hell shall find me?", "7__They that trust": ": As much as to say, let them fear that trust in their strength or riches: for they have great reason to fear: seeing no brother or other man, how much a friend soever, can by any price or labour rescue them from death.", "9__And shall labour for ever": ": This seems to be a continuation of the foregoing sentence: as much as to say no man can by any price or ransom prolong his life, that so he may still continue to labour here, and live to the end of the world. Others understand it of the eternal sorrows, and dying life of hell, which is the dreadful consequence of dying in sin.", "11__He shall not see destruction": ": Or, shall he not see destruction? As much as to say, however thoughtless he may be of his death, he must not expect to escape; when even the wise and the good are not exempt from dying.", "12__They have called": ": That is, they have left their names on their graves, which alone remain of their lands.", "14__They shall delight in their mouth": ": Notwithstanding the wretched way in which they walk, they shall applaud themselves with their mouths, and glory in their doings.", "15__In the morning": ": That is, in the resurrection to a new life; when the just shall judge and condemn the wicked. Ibid.", "15__From their glory": ": That is, when their short-lived glory in this world shall be past, and be no more."}}

{"Psalms__52": {"1__Maeleth": ": Or Machalath. A musical instrument, or a chorus of musicians, for St. Jerome renders it, per chorum.", "6__God hath scattered the bones": ": That is, God has brought to nothing the strength of all those that seek to please men, to the prejudice of their duty to their Maker."}}

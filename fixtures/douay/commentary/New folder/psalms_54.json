{"Psalms__54": {"16__Let death": ": This, and such like imprecations which occur in the psalms, are delivered prophetically; that is, by way of foretelling the punishments which shall fall upon the wicked from divine justice, and approving the righteous ways of God: but not by way of ill will, or uncharitable curses, which the law of God disallows.", "19__Among many": ": That is, they that drew near to attack me were many in company all combined to fight against me.", "22__They are divided": ": Dispersed, scattered, and brought to nothing, by the wrath of God; who looks with indignation on their wicked and deceitful ways."}}

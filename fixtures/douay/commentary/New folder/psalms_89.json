{"Psalms__89": {"3__Turn not man away": ": Suffer him not quite to perish from thee, since thou art pleased to call upon him to be converted to thee.", "9__As a spider": ": As frail and weak as a spider's web; and miserable withal, whilst like a spider we spend our bowels in weaving webs to catch flies.", "10__Mildness is come upon us": ": God's mildness corrects us; inasmuch as he deals kindly with us, in shortening the days of this miserable life; and so weaning our affections from all its transitory enjoyments, and teaching us true wisdom."}}

{"Romans__14": {"2__Eat all things": ": Viz., without observing the distinction of clean and unclean meats, prescribed by the law of Moses: which was now no longer obligatory. Some weak Christians, converted from among the Jews, as we here gather from the apostle, made a scruple of eating such meats as were deemed unclean by the law; such as swine's flesh, etc., which the stronger sort of Christians did eat without scruple. Now the apostle, to reconcile them together, exhorts the former not to judge or condemn the latter, using their Christian liberty; and the latter, to take care not to despise or scandalize their weaker brethren, either by bringing them to eat what in their conscience they think they should not, or by giving them such offence, as to endanger the driving them thereby from the Christian religion.", "5__Between day": ": Still observing the sabbaths and festivals of the law.", "23__Discerneth": ": That is, distinguisheth between meats, and eateth against his conscience, what he deems unclean.", "23__Of faith": ": By faith is here understood judgment and conscience: to act against which is always a sin."}}

{"Solomon or Canticles__04": {"1__How beautiful art thou": ": Christ again praises the beauties of his church, which through the whole of this chapter are exemplified by a variety of metaphors, setting forth her purity, her simplicity, and her stability.", "5__Thy two breasts": ": Mystically to be understood: the love of God and the love of our neighbour, which are so united as twins which feed among the lilies: that is, the love of God and our neighbour, feeds on the divine mysteries and the holy sacraments, left by Christ to his spouse to feed and nourish her children.", "12__A garden enclosed": ": Figuratively the church is enclosed, containing only the faithful.", "12__A fountain sealed up": ": That none can drink of its waters, that is, the graces and spiritual benefits of the holy sacraments, but those who are within its walls."}}

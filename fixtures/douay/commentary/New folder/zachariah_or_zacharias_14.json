{"Zachariah or Zacharias__14": {"2__I will gather": ": This seems to be a prophecy of what was done by Antiochus.", "6__No light": ": Viz., in that dismal time of persecution of Antiochus, when it was neither day nor night: (ver. 7) because they neither had the comfortable light of the day, nor the repose of the night.", "7__In the time of the evening there shall be light": ": An unexpected light shall arise by the means of the Machabees, when things shall seem to be at the worst.", "8__Living waters": ": Viz., the gospel of Christ.", "10__All the land shall return": ": This, in some measure, was verified by the means of the Machabees: but is rather to be taken in a spiritual sense, as relating to the propagation of the church, and kingdom of Christ, the true Jerusalem, which alone shall never fall under the anathema of destruction, or God's curse.", "12__The flesh of every one shall consume": ": Such judgments as these have often fallen upon the persecutors of God's church, as appears by many instances in history.", "14__Even Juda": ": The carnal Jews, and other false brothers, shall join in persecuting the church.", "15__Shall be like this destruction": ": That is, the beasts shall be destroyed as well as the men: the common soldiers as well as their leaders.", "16__They that shall be left": ": That is, many of them that persecuted the church shall be converted to its faith and communion.-- Ibid.", "16__To keep the feast of tabernacles": ": This feast was kept by the Jews in memory of their sojourning forty years in the desert, in their way to the land of promise. And in the spiritual sense is duly kept by all such Christians as in their earthly pilgrimage are continually advancing toward their true home, the heavenly Jerusalem; by the help of the sacraments and sacrifice of the church. And they that neglect this must not look for the kind showers of divine grace, to give fruitfulness to their souls.", "20__That which is upon the bridle": ": The golden ornaments of the bridles, etc., shall be turned into offerings in the house of God. And there shall be an abundance of caldrons and phials for the sacrifices of the temple; by which is meant, under a figure, the great resort there shall be to the temple, that is, to the church of Christ, and her sacrifice.", "21__The merchant shall be no more": ": Or, as some render it, The Chanaanite shall be no more, that is, the profane and unbelievers shall have no title to be in the house of the Lord. Or there shall be no occasion for buyers or sellers of oxen, or sheep, or doves, in the house of God, such as Jesus Christ cast out of the temple."}}

{"2 John__01": {"1__The ancient": "That is, the ancient bishop St. John, being the only one of the twelve apostles then living.", "1__To the lady Elect": "Some conjecture that Elect might be the name of a family, or of a particular church; but the general opinion is, that it is the proper name of a lady, so eminent for her piety and great charity, as to merit this Epistle from St. John.", "10__Nor say to him, God speed you": "This admonition is in general, to forewarn the faithful of the dangers which may arise from a familiarity with those who have prevaricated and gone from the true faith, and with such as teach false doctrine. But this is not forbidding a charity for all men, by which we ought to wish and pray for the eternal salvation of every one, even of our enemies."}}

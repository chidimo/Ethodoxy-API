{"Daniel__04": {"5__Baltassar, according to the name of my god": "He says this, because the name of Baltassar, or Belteshazzar, is derived from the name of Bel, the chief god of the Babylonians.", "10__A watcher": "A vigilant angel, perhaps the guardian of Israel.", "13__Let his heart be changed": "It does not appear by scripture that Nabuchodonosor was changed from human shape; much less that he was changed into an ox; but only that he lost his reason, and became mad; and in this condition remained abroad in the company of beasts, eating grass like an ox, till his hair grew in such manner as to resemble the feathers of eagles, and his nails to be like birds' claws.", "34__I Nabuchodonosor do now": "From this place some commentators infer that this king became a true convert, and dying not long after, was probably saved."}}

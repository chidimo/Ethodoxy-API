{"Ecclesiasticus *__23": {"1__By them": "Viz., the tongue and the lips, mentioned in the last verse of the foregoing chapter.", "2__That they spare me not in their ignorances": "That is, that the scourges and discipline of wisdom may restrain the ignorances, that is, the slips and offences which are usually committed by the tongue and the lips."}}

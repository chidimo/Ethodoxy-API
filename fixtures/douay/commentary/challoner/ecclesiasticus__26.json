{"Ecclesiasticus *__26": {"28__From negligence": "That is, from the neglect of the service of Godbecause the eager pursuit of the mammon of this world, is apt to make men of that calling forget the great duties of loving God above all things, and their neighbours as themselves.-- Ibid.", "28__A huckster": "Or, a retailer of wine. Men of that profession are both greatly exposed to danger of sin themselves, and are too often accessary to the sins of others."}}

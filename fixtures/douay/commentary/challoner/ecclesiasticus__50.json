{"Ecclesiasticus *__50": {"11__Clothed with the perfection of power": "That is, with all the vestments denoting his dignity and authority.", "27__Abhorreth": "Viz., with a holy indignation, as enemies of God and persecutors of his people. Such were then the Edomites who abode in mount Seir, the Philistines, and the Samaritans who dwelt in Sichem, and had their schismatical temple in that neighbourhood."}}

{"Ezeckiel or Ezechiel__28": {"3__Thou art wiser than Daniel": "Viz., in thy own conceit. The wisdom of Daniel was so much celebrated in his days, that it became a proverb amongst the Chaldeans, when any one would express an extraordinary wisdom, to say he was as wise as Daniel.", "12__Thou wast the seal of resemblance": "The king of Tyre, by his dignity and his natural perfections, bore in himself a certain resemblance to God, by reason of which he might be called the seal of resemblance, etc. But what is here said to him is commonly understood of Lucifer, the king over all the children of pride.", "14__A cherub stretched out": "That is, thy wings extended. This alludes to the figure of the cherubims in the sanctuary, which with stretched out wings covered the ark.-- Ibid.", "14__The stones of fire": "That is, bright and precious stones which sparkle like fire."}}

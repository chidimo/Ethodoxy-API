{"Genesis__03": {"7__And the eyes": "Not that they were blind before, (for the woman saw that the tree was fair to the eyes, ver. 6.) nor yet that their eyes were opened to any more perfect knowledge of good; but only to the unhappy experience of having lost the good of original grace and innocence, and incurred the dreadful evil of sin. From whence followed a shame of their being naked; which they minded not before; because being now stript of original grace, they quickly began to be subject to the shameful rebellions of the flesh.", "15__She shall crush": "Ipsa, the woman; so divers of the fathers read this place, conformably to the Latinothers read it ipsum, viz., the seed. The sense is the samefor it is by her seed, Jesus Christ, that the woman crushes the serpent's head.", "22__Behold Adam": "This was spoken by way of reproaching him with his pride, in affecting a knowledge that might make him like to God."}}

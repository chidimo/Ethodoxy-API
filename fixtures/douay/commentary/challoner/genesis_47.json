{"Genesis__47": {"2__The last": "Extremos. Some interpret this word of the chiefest, and most rightlybut Joseph seems rather to have chosen out such as had the meanest appearance, that Pharao might not think of employing them at court, with danger of their morals and religion.", "31__To the bed's head": "St. Paul, Heb. 11. 21, following the Greek translation of the Septuagint, reads adored the top of his rod. Where note, that the same word in the Hebrew, according to the different pointing of it, signifies both a bed and a rod. And to verify both these sentences, we must understand that Jacob leaning on Joseph's rod adored, turning towards the head of his bedwhich adoration, inasmuch as it was referred to God, was an absolute and sovereign worshipbut inasmuch as it was referred to the rod of Joseph, as a figure of the sceptre, that is, of the royal dignity of Christ, was only an inferior and relative honour."}}

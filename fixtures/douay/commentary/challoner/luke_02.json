{"Luke__02": {"7__Her firstborn": "The meaning is, not that she had afterward any other child; but it is a way of speech among the Hebrews, to call them also the firstborn, who are the only children. See annotation Matt. 1. 25.", "34__For the fall": "Christ came for the salvation of all men; but here Simeon prophesies what would come to pass, that many through their own wilful blindness and obstinacy would not believe in Christ, nor receive his doctrine, which therefore would be ruin to thembut to others a resurrection, by their believing in him, and obeying his commandments."}}

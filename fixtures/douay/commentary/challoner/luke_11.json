{"Luke__11": {"46__Woe to you lawyers": "He speaks of the doctors of the law of Moses, commonly called the scribes.", "47__Woe to you who build": "Not that the building of the monuments of the prophets was in itself blameworthy, but only the intention of these unhappy men, who made use of this outward shew of religion and piety, as a means to carry on their wicked designs against the prince of prophets."}}

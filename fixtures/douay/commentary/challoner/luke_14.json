{"Luke__14": {"26__Hate not": "The law of Christ does not allow us to hate even our enemies, much less our parentsbut the meaning of the text is, that we must be in that disposition of soul, as to be willing to renounce, and part with every thing, how near or dear soever it may be to us, that would keep us from following Christ."}}

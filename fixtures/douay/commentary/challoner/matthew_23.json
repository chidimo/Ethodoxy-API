{"Matthew__23": {"5__Phylacteries": "that is, parchments, on which they wrote the ten commandments, and carried them on their foreheads before their eyeswhich the Pharisees affected to wear broader than other men; so to seem more zealous for the law.", "9__Call none your father upon earth": "Neither be ye called masters. The meaning is that our Father in heaven is incomparably more to be regarded, than any father upon earthand no master to be followed, who would lead us away from Christ. But this does not hinder but that we are by the law of God to have a due respect both for our parents and spiritual fathers, (1 Cor. 4. 15) and for our masters and teachers.", "29__Build the sepulchres": "This is not blamed, as if it were in itself evil to build or adorn the monuments of the prophetsbut the hypocrisy of the Pharisees is here taxed; who, whilst they pretended to honour the memory of the prophets, were persecuting even unto death the Lord of the prophets.", "35__That upon you may come": "Not that they should suffer more than their own sins justly deserved; but that the justice of God should now fall upon them with such a final vengeance, once for all, as might comprise all the different kinds of judgments and punishments, that had at any time before been inflicted for the shedding of just blood."}}

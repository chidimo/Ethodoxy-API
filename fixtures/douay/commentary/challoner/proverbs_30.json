{"Proverbs__30": {"1__Gatherer": "Or, as it is in the Latin, Congregans the son of Vomens. The Latin interpreter has given us in this place the signification of the Hebrew names, instead of the names themselves, which are in the Hebrew, Agur the son of Jakeh. But whether this Agur be the same person as Solomon, as many think, or a different person, whose doctrine was adopted by Solomon, and inserted among his parables or proverbs, is uncertain.", "5__Is fire tried": "That is, most pure, like gold purified by fire.", "15__The horseleech": "Concupiscence, which hath two daughters that are never satisfied, viz., lust and avarice.", "28__The stellio": "A kind of house lizard marked with spots like stars, from whence it has its name."}}

{"Psalms__06": {"1__For the octave": "That is, to be sung on an instrument of eight strings. St. Augustine understands it mystically, of the last resurrection, and the world to come; which is, as it were, the octave, or eighth day, after the seven days of this mortal lifeand for this octave, sinners must dispose themselves, like David, by bewailing their sins, whilst they are here upon earth."}}

{"Psalms__86": {"1__The holy mountains": "The apostles and prophets. Eph. 2. 20.", "4__Rahab": "Egypt, etc. To this Sion, which is the church of God, many shall resort from all nations.", "5__Shall not Sion say": "The meaning is, that Sion, viz., the church, shall not only be able to commemorate this or that particular person of renown born in her, but also to glory in great multitudes of people and princes of her communion; who have been foretold in the writings of the prophets, and registered in the writings of the apostles."}}

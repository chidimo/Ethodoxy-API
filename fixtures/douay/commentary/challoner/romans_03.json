{"Romans__03": {"4__God is true": "God only is essentially true. All men in their own capacity are liable to lies and errorsnevertheless God, who is the truth, will make good his promise of keeping his church in all truth. See St. John 16. 13.", "10__There is not any man just": "viz. By virtue either of the law of nature, or of the law of Moses; but only by faith and grace.", "28__By faith": "The faith, to which the apostle here attributes man's justification, is not a presumptuous assurance of our being justified; but a firm and lively belief of all that God has revealed or promised. Heb. 11. A faith working through charity in Jesus Christ. Gal. 5. 6. In short, a faith which takes in hope, love, repentance, and the use of the sacraments. And the works which he here excludes, are only the works of the lawthat is, such as are done by the law of nature, or that of Moses, antecedent to the faith of Christbut by no means, such as follow faith, and proceed from it."}}

{"Solomon or Canticles__01": {"1__Let him kiss me": "The church, the spouse of Christ, prays that he may love and have peace with her, which the spouse prefers to every thing deliciousand therefore expresses (ver. 2) that young maidens, that is the souls of the faithful, have loved thee.", "3__Draw me": "That is, with thy graceotherwise I should not be able to come to thee. This metaphor shews that we cannot of ourselves come to Christ our Lord, unless he draws us by his grace, which is laid up in his storeroomsthat is, in the mysteries of Faith, which God in his goodness and love for mankind hath revealed, first by his servant Moses in the Old Law in figure only, and afterwards in reality by his only begotten Son Jesus Christ.", "4__I am black but beautiful": "That is, the church of Christ founded in humility appearing outwardly afflicted, and as it were black and contemptible; but inwardly, that is, in its doctrine and morality, fair and beautiful.", "7__If thou know not thyself": "Christ encourages his spouse to follow and watch her flockand though she know not entirely the power at hand to assist her, he tells her, ver. 8, my company of horsemen, that is, his angels, are always watching and protecting her. And in the following verses he reminds her of the virtues and gifts with which he has endowed her."}}

Obededom: and Jehiel over the instruments of psaltery, and harps: and Asaph sounded with cymbals: \n", "6": " But Banaias, and Jaziel the priests, to sound the trumpet continually before the ark of the covenant of the Lord. \n", "7": " In that day David made Asaph the chief to give praise to the Lord with his brethren. \n", "8": " Praise ye the Lord, and call upon his name: make known his doings

covenant: \n", "18": " Saying: To thee will I give the land of Chanaan: the lot of your inheritance. \n", "19": " When they were but a small number: very few and sojourners in it. \n", "20": " And they passed from nation to nation: and from a kingdom to another people. \n", "21": " He suffered no man to do them wrong: and reproved kings for their sake. \n", "22": " Touch not my anointed: and do

immoveable. \n", "31": " Let the heavens rejoice, and the earth be glad: and let them say among the nations: The Lord hath reigned. \n", "32": " Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all things that are in them. \n", "33": " Then shall the trees of the wood give praise before the Lord: because he is come to judge the earth. \n", "34": " Give ye glory to the Lord, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever. \n", "35": " And say ye: Save us, O God our saviour: and gather us together, and deliver us from the nations, that we may give glory to thy holy name, and may rejoice in singing thy praises. \n", "36": " Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from eternity to eternity: and let all the people say Amen, and a hymn to God. \n", "37": " So he left

And all the people returned to their houses: and David to bless also his own house. \n"}}

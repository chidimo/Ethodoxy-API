{"1 Corinthians__03": {"1": " And I, brethren, could not speak to you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal. As unto little ones in Christ. \n", "2": " I gave you milk to drink, not meat; for you were not able as yet. But neither indeed are you now able; for you are yet carnal. \n", "3": " For, whereas there is among you envying and contention, are you not carnal, and walk according to man? \n", "4": " For while one saith, I indeed am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollo; are you not men? What then is Apollo, and what is Paul? \n", "5": " The ministers of him whom you have believed; and to every one as the Lord hath given. \n", "6": " I have planted, Apollo watered, but God gave the increase. \n", "7": " Therefore, neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase. \n", "8": " Now he that planteth, and he that watereth, are one. And every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own labour. \n", "9": " For we are God's coadjutors: you are God's husbandry; you are God's building. \n", "10": " According to the grace of God that is given to me, as a wise architect, I have laid the foundation; and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon. \n", "11": " For other foundation no man can lay, but that which is laid; which is Christ Jesus. \n", "12": " Now if any man build <u>upon this foundation</u>, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble: \n", "13": " Every man's work shall be manifest; for the day of the Lord shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in fire; and the fire shall try every man's work, of what sort it is. \n", "14": " If any man's work abide, which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward. \n", "15": " If any man's work burn, he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire. \n", "16": " Know you not, that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? \n", "17": " But if any man violate the temple of God, him shall God destroy. For the temple of God is holy, which you are. \n", "18": " Let no man deceive himself: if any man among you seem to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. \n", "19": " For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written: I will catch the wise in their own craftiness. \n", "20": " And again: The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain. \n", "21": " Let no man therefore glory in men. \n", "22": " For all things are yours, whether it be Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; for all are yours; \n", "23": " And you are Christ's; and Christ is God's. \n"}}

{"1 Corinthians__05": {"1": " It is absolutely heard, that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as the like is not among the heathens; that one should have his father's wife. \n", "2": " And you are puffed up; and have not rather mourned, that he might be taken away from among you, that hath done this deed. \n", "3": " I indeed, absent in body, but present in spirit, have already judged, as though I were present, him that hath so done, \n", "4": " In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you being gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus; \n", "5": " To deliver such a one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. \n", "6": " Your glorying is not good. Know you not that a little leaven corrupteth the whole lump? \n", "7": " Purge out the old leaven, that you may be a new paste, as you are unleavened. For Christ our pasch is sacrificed. \n", "8": " Therefore let us feast, not with the old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. \n", "9": " I wrote to you in an epistle, not to keep company with fornicators. \n", "10": " I mean not with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or the extortioners, or the servers of idols; otherwise you must needs go out of this world. \n", "11": " But now I have written to you, not to keep company, if any man that is named a brother, be a fornicator, or covetous, or a server of idols, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner: with such a one, not so much as to eat. \n", "12": " For what have I to do to judge them that are without? Do not you judge them that are within? \n", "13": " For them that are without, God will judge. Put away the evil one from among yourselves. \n"}}

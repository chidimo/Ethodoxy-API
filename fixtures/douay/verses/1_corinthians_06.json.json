{"1 Corinthians__06": {"1": " Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to be judged before the unjust, and not before the saints? \n", "2": " Know you not that the saints shall judge this world? And if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters? \n", "3": " Know you not that we shall judge angels? how much more things of this world? \n", "4": " If therefore you have judgments of things pertaining to this world, set them to judge, who are the most despised in the church. \n", "5": " I speak to your shame. Is it so that there is not among you any one wise man, that is able to judge between his brethren? \n", "6": " But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers. \n", "7": " Already indeed there is plainly <u>a fault</u> among you, that you have lawsuits one with another. Why do you not rather take wrong? Why do you not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded? \n", "8": " But you do wrong and defraud, and that to your brethren. \n", "9": " Know you not that the unjust shall not possess the kingdom of God? Do not err: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, \n", "10": " Nor the effeminate, nor liers with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor extortioners, shall possess the kingdom of God. \n", "11": " And such some of you were; but you are washed, but you are sanctified, but you are justified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Spirit of our God. \n", "12": " <u>All things are lawful</u> to me, but all things are not expedient. All things are lawful to me, but I will not be brought under the power of any. \n", "13": " Meat for the belly, and the belly for the meats; but God shall destroy both it and them: but the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. \n", "14": " Now God hath both raised up the Lord, and will raise us up also by his power. \n", "15": " Know you not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid. \n", "16": " Or know you not, that he who is joined to a harlot, is made one body? For they shall be, saith he, two in one flesh. \n", "17": " But he who is joined to the Lord, is one spirit. \n", "18": " Fly fornication. Every sin that a man doth, is without the body; but he that committeth fornication, sinneth against his own body. \n", "19": " Or know you not, that your members are the temple of the Holy Ghost, who is in you, whom you have from God; and you are not your own? \n", "20": " For you are bought with a great price. Glorify and bear God in your body. \n"}}

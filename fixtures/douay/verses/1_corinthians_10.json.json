{"1 Corinthians__10": {"1": " For I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea. \n", "2": " And all <u>in Moses</u> were baptized, in the cloud, and in the sea: \n", "3": " And did all eat the same spiritual food, \n", "4": " And all drank the same spiritual drink; (and they drank of the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ.) \n", "5": " But with most of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the desert. \n", "6": " Now these things were done in a figure of us, that we should not covet evil things as they also coveted. \n", "7": " Neither become ye idolaters, as some of them, as it is written: The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. \n", "8": " Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed fornication, and there fell in one day three and twenty thousand. \n", "9": " Neither let us tempt Christ: as some of them tempted, and perished by the serpents. \n", "10": " Neither do you murmur: as some of them murmured, and were destroyed by the destroyer. \n", "11": " Now all these things happened to them in figure: and they are written for our correction, upon whom <u>the ends of the world</u> are come. \n", "12": " Wherefore he that thinketh himself to stand, let him take heed lest he fall. \n", "13": " Let no temptation <u>take hold on you</u>, but such as is human. And God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able: but will make also with temptation issue, that you may be able to bear it. \n", "14": " Wherefore, my dearly beloved, fly from the service of idols. \n", "15": " I speak as to wise men: judge ye yourselves what I say. \n", "16": " The chalice of benediction, <u>which we bless</u>, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? And the bread, which we break, is it not the partaking of the body of the Lord? \n", "17": " For we, being many, are <u>one bread</u>, one body, all that partake of one bread. \n", "18": " Behold Israel according to the flesh: are not they, that eat of the sacrifices, partakers of the altar? \n", "19": " What then? Do I say, that what is offered in sacrifice to idols, is any thing? Or, that the idol is any thing? \n", "20": " But the things which the heathens sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God. And I would not that you should be made partakers with devils. \n", "21": " You cannot drink the chalice of the Lord, and the chalice of devils: you cannot be partakers of the table of the Lord, and of the table of devils. \n", "22": " Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he? All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient. \n", "23": " All things are lawful for me, but all things do not edify. \n", "24": " Let no man seek his own, but that which is another's. \n", "25": " Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, eat; asking no question for conscience' sake. \n", "26": " The earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof. \n", "27": " If any of them that believe not, invite you, and you will be willing to go; eat of any thing that is set before you, asking no question for conscience' sake. \n", "28": " But if any man say: This has been sacrificed to idols, do not eat of it for his sake that told it, and for conscience' sake. \n", "29": " Conscience, I say, not thy own, but the other's. For why is my liberty judged by another man's conscience? \n", "30": " If I partake with thanksgiving, why am I evil spoken of, for that for which I give thanks? \n", "31": " Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all to the glory of God. \n", "32": " Be without offence to the Jews, and to the Gentiles, and to the church of God: \n", "33": " As I also in all things please all men, not seeking that which is profitable to myself, but to many, that may be saved. \n"}}

{"1 Corinthians__11": {"1": " Be ye followers of me, as I also am of Christ. \n", "2": " Now I praise you, brethren, that in all things you are mindful of me: and keep my ordinances as I have delivered them to you. \n", "3": " But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. \n", "4": " Every man praying or prophesying with his head covered, disgraceth his head. \n", "5": " But every woman praying or prophesying with her head not covered, disgraceth her head: for it is all one as if she were shaven. \n", "6": " For if a woman be not covered, let her be shorn. But if it be a shame to a woman to be shorn or made bald, let her cover her head. \n", "7": " The man indeed ought not to cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man. \n", "8": " For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man. \n", "9": " For the man was not created for the woman, but the woman for the man. \n", "10": " Therefore ought the woman to have <u>a power</u> over her head, because of the angels. \n", "11": " But yet neither is the man without the woman, nor the woman without the man, in the Lord. \n", "12": " For as the woman is of the man, so also is the man by the woman: but all things of God. \n", "13": " You yourselves judge: doth it become a woman, to pray unto God uncovered? \n", "14": " Doth not even nature itself teach you, that a man indeed, if he nourish his hair, it is a shame unto him? \n", "15": " But if a woman nourish her hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given to her for a covering. \n", "16": " But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, nor the church of God. \n", "17": " Now this I ordain: not praising you, that you come together not for the better, but for the worse. \n", "18": " For first of all I hear that when you come together in the church, there are schisms among you; and in part I believe it. \n", "19": " For <u>there must be also heresies</u>: that they also, who are approved, may be made manifest among you. \n", "20": " When you come therefore together into one place, it is not now to eat <u>the Lord's supper</u>. \n", "21": " For every one taketh before his own supper to eat. And one indeed is hungry and another is drunk. \n", "22": " What, have you not houses to eat and to drink in? Or despise ye the church of God; and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? Do I praise you? In this I praise you not. \n", "23": " For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was betrayed, took bread. \n", "24": " And giving thanks, broke, and said: Take ye, and eat: this is my body, which shall be delivered for you: this do for the commemoration of me. \n", "25": " In like manner also the chalice, after he had supped, saying: This chalice is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as often as you shall drink, for the commemoration of me. \n", "26": " For as often as you shall eat this bread, and drink the chalice, you shall shew the death of the Lord, until he come. \n", "27": " Therefore whosoever shall eat this bread, <u>or drink</u> the chalice of the Lord unworthily, shall be <u>guilty of the body</u> and of the blood of the Lord. \n", "28": " But let a man prove himself: and so let him eat of that bread, and <u>drink of the chalice</u>. \n", "29": " For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself, not discerning the body of the Lord. \n", "30": " Therefore are there many infirm and weak among you, and many sleep. \n", "31": " But if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged. \n", "32": " But whilst we are judged, we are chastised by the Lord, that we be not condemned with this world. \n", "33": " Wherefore, my brethren, when you come together to eat, wait for one another. \n", "34": " If any man be hungry, let him eat at home; that you come not together unto judgment. And the rest I will set in order, when I come. \n"}}

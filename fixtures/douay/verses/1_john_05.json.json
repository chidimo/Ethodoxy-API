{"1 John__05": {"1": " Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ, <u>is born of God</u>. And every one that loveth him who begot, loveth him also who is born of him. \n", "2": " In this we know that we love the children of God: when we love God, and keep his commandments. \n", "3": " For this is the charity of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not heavy. \n", "4": " For whatsoever is born of God, overcometh the world: and this is the victory which overcometh the world, <u>our faith</u>. \n", "5": " Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God? \n", "6": " This is he that <u>came by water and blood</u>, Jesus Christ: not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit which testifieth, that Christ is the truth. \n", "7": " And there are three who give testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. And these three are one. \n", "8": " And there are three that give testimony on earth: <u>the spirit, and the water, and the blood</u>: and these three are one. \n", "9": " If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater. For this is the testimony of God, which is greater, because he hath testified of his Son. \n", "10": " He that believeth in the Son of God, hath the testimony of God in himself. <u>He that believeth not the Son</u>, maketh him a liar: because he believeth not in the testimony which God hath testified of his Son. \n", "11": " And this is the testimony, that God hath given to us eternal life. And this life is in his Son. \n", "12": " He that hath the Son, hath life. He that hath not the Son, hath not life. \n", "13": " These things I write to you, that you may know that you have eternal life, you who believe in the name of the Son of God. \n", "14": " And this is the confidence which we have towards him: That, whatsoever we shall ask according to his will, he heareth us. \n", "15": " And we know that he heareth us whatsoever we ask: we know that we have the petitions which we request of him. \n", "16": " He that knoweth his brother to sin <u>a sin which is not to death</u>, let him ask, and life shall be given to him, who sinneth not to death. There is <u>a sin unto death</u>: for that I say not that any man ask. \n", "17": " All iniquity is sin. And there is a sin unto death. \n", "18": " We know that whosoever is born of God, sinneth not: but the generation of God preserveth him, and the wicked one toucheth him not. \n", "19": " We know that we are of God, and <u>the whole world is seated in wickedness</u>. \n", "20": " And we know that the Son of God is come: and he hath given us understanding that we may know the true God, <u>and may be in his true Son</u>. This is the true God and life eternal. \n", "21": " Little children, <u>keep yourselves from idols</u>. Amen. \n"}}

{"1 Peter__02": {"1": " Wherefore laying away all malice, and all guile, and dissimulations, and envies, and all detractions, \n", "2": " As newborn babes, desire the rational milk without guile, that thereby you may grow unto salvation: \n", "3": " If so be you have tasted that the Lord is sweet. \n", "4": " Unto whom coming, as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen and made honourable by God: \n", "5": " Be you also as living stones built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. \n", "6": " Wherefore it is said in the scripture: Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious. And he that shall believe in him, shall not be confounded. \n", "7": " To you therefore that believe, he is honour: but to them that believe not, the stone which the builders rejected, the same is made the head of the corner: \n", "8": " And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of scandal, to them who stumble at the word, neither do believe, whereunto also they are set. \n", "9": " But you are a chosen generation, a kingly priesthood, a holy nation, a purchased people: that you may declare his virtues, who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light: \n", "10": " Who in time past were not a people: but are now the people of God. Who had not obtained mercy; but now have obtained mercy. \n", "11": " Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, to refrain yourselves from carnal desires which war against the soul, \n", "12": " Having your conversation good among the Gentiles: that whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by the good works, which they shall behold in you, glorify God in the day of visitation. \n", "13": " Be ye subject therefore to every human creature for God's sake: whether it be to the king as excelling; \n", "14": " Or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of the good: \n", "15": " For so is the will of God, that by doing well you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men: \n", "16": " As free, and not as making liberty a cloak for malice, but as the servants of God. \n", "17": " Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king. \n", "18": " Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the froward. \n", "19": " For this is thankworthy, if for conscience towards God, a man endure sorrows, suffering wrongfully. \n", "20": " For what glory is it, if committing sin, and being buffeted for it, you endure? But if doing well you suffer patiently; this is thankworthy before God. \n", "21": " For unto this are you called: because Christ also suffered for us, leaving you an example that you should follow his steps. \n", "22": " Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth. \n", "23": " Who, when he was reviled, did not revile: when he suffered, he threatened not: but delivered himself to him that judged him unjustly. \n", "24": " Who his own self bore our sins in his body upon the tree: that we, being dead to sins, should live to justice: by whose stripes you were healed. \n", "25": " For you were as sheep going astray; but you are now converted to the shepherd and bishop of your souls. \n"}}

{"1 Peter__03": {"1": " In like manner also let wives be subject to their husbands: that if any believe not the word, they may be won without the word, by the conversation of the wives. \n", "2": " Considering your chaste conversation with fear. \n", "3": " Whose adorning let it not be the outward plaiting of the hair, or the wearing of gold, or the putting on of apparel: \n", "4": " But the hidden man of the heart in the incorruptibility of a quiet and a meek spirit, which is rich in the sight of God. \n", "5": " For after this manner heretofore the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection to their own husbands: \n", "6": " As Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters you are, doing well, and not fearing any disturbance. \n", "7": " Ye husbands, likewise dwelling with them according to knowledge, giving honour to the female as to the weaker vessel, and as to the co-heirs of the grace of life: that your prayers be not hindered. \n", "8": " And in fine, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another, being lovers of the brotherhood, merciful, modest, humble: \n", "9": " Not rendering evil for evil, nor railing for railing, but contrariwise, blessing: for unto this are you called, that you may inherit a blessing. \n", "10": " For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile. \n", "11": " Let him decline from evil, and do good: let him seek after peace and pursue it: \n", "12": " Because the eyes of the Lord are upon the just, and his ears unto their prayers: but the countenance of the Lord upon them that do evil things. \n", "13": " And who is he that can hurt you, if you be zealous of good? \n", "14": " But if also you suffer any thing for justice' sake, blessed are ye. And be not afraid of their fear, and be not troubled. \n", "15": " But sanctify the Lord Christ in your hearts, being ready always to satisfy every one that asketh you a reason of that hope which is in you. \n", "16": " But with modesty and fear, having a good conscience: that whereas they speak evil of you, they may be ashamed who falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ. \n", "17": " For it is better doing well (if such be the will of God) to suffer, than doing ill. \n", "18": " Because Christ also died once for our sins, the just for the unjust: that he might offer us to God, being put to death indeed in the flesh, but enlivened in the spirit, \n", "19": " In which also coming he preached to those <u>spirits that were in prison</u>: \n", "20": " Which had been some time incredulous, when they waited for the patience of God in the days of Noe, when the ark was a building: wherein a few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water. \n", "21": " <u>Whereunto baptism</u> being of the like form, now saveth you also: <u>not the putting away</u> of the filth of the flesh, but the examination of a good conscience towards God by the resurrection of Jesus Christ. \n", "22": " Who is on the right hand of God, swallowing down death, that we might be made heirs of life everlasting: being gone into heaven, the angels and powers and virtues being made subject to him. \n"}}

{"2 Corinthians__06": {"1": " And we helping do exhort you, that you receive not the grace of God in vain. \n", "2": " For he saith: In an accepted time have I heard thee; and in the day of salvation have I helped thee. Behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation. \n", "3": " Giving no offence to any man, that our ministry be not blamed: \n", "4": " But in all things let us exhibit ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in tribulation, in necessities, in distresses, \n", "5": " In stripes, in prisons, in seditions, in labours, in watchings, in fastings, \n", "6": " In chastity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in sweetness, in the Holy Ghost, in charity unfeigned, \n", "7": " In the word of truth, in the power of God; by the armour of justice on the right hand and on the left; \n", "8": " By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet known; \n", "9": " As dying, and behold we live; as chastised, and not killed; \n", "10": " As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as needy, yet enriching many; as having nothing, and possessing all things. \n", "11": " Our mouth is open to you, O ye Corinthians, our heart is enlarged. \n", "12": " You are not straitened in us, but in your own bowels you are straitened. \n", "13": " But having the same recompense, (I speak as to my children,) be you also enlarged. \n", "14": " Bear not the yoke with unbelievers. For what participation hath justice with injustice? Or what fellowship hath light with darkness? \n", "15": " And what concord hath Christ with Belial? Or what part hath the faithful with the unbeliever? \n", "16": " And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God; as God saith: I will dwell in them, and walk among them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. \n", "17": " Wherefore, Go out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing: \n", "18": " And I will receive you; and I will be a Father to you; and you shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. \n"}}

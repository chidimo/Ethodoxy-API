{"2 Corinthians__12": {"1": " If I must glory (it is not expedient indeed), but I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord. \n", "2": " I know a man in Christ above fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I know not, or out of the body, I know not; God knoweth), such a one caught up to the third heaven. \n", "3": " And I know such a man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I know not: God knoweth), \n", "4": " That he was caught up into paradise, and heard secret words, which it is not granted to man to utter. \n", "5": " For such an one I will glory; but for myself I will glory nothing, but in my infirmities. \n", "6": " For though I should have a mind to glory, I shall not be foolish; for I will say the truth. But I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth in me, or any thing he heareth from me. \n", "7": " And lest the greatness of the revelations should exalt me, there was given me a sting of my flesh, an angel of Satan, to buffet me. \n", "8": " For which thing thrice I besought the Lord, that it might depart from me. \n", "9": " And he said to me: My grace is sufficient for thee; for <u>power is made perfect</u> in infirmity. Gladly therefore will I glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may dwell in me. \n", "10": " For which cause I please myself in my infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ. For when I am weak, then am I powerful. \n", "11": " I am become foolish: you have compelled me. For I ought to have been commended by you: for I have no way come short of them that are above measure apostles, although I be nothing. \n", "12": " Yet the signs of my apostleship have been wrought on you, in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds. \n", "13": " For what is there that you have had less than the other churches, but that I myself was not burthensome to you? Pardon me this injury. \n", "14": " Behold now the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burthensome unto you. For I seek not the things that are yours, but you. For neither ought the children to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children. \n", "15": " But I most gladly will spend and be spent myself for your souls; although loving you more, I be loved less. \n", "16": " But be it so: I did not burthen you: but being crafty, I caught you by guile. \n", "17": " Did I overreach you by any of them whom I sent to you? \n", "18": " I desired Titus, and I sent with him a brother. Did Titus overreach you? Did we not walk with the same spirit? did we not in the same steps? \n", "19": " Of old, think you that we excuse ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ; but all things, my dearly beloved, for your edification. \n", "20": " For I fear lest perhaps when I come I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found by you such as you would not. Lest perhaps contentions, envyings, animosities, dissensions, detractions, whisperings, swellings, seditions, be among you. \n", "21": " Lest again, when I come, God humble me among you: and I mourn many of them that sinned before, and have not done penance for the uncleanness, and fornication, and lasciviousness, that they have committed. \n"}}

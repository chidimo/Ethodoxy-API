For doing these things, you shall not sin at any time. \n", "11": " For so an entrance shall be ministered to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. \n", "12": " For which cause I will begin to put you always in remembrance of these things: though indeed you know them, and are confirmed in the present truth. \n", "13": " But I think it meet as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance. \n", "14": " Being assured that the laying away of this my tabernacle is at hand, according as our Lord Jesus Christ also hath signified to me. \n", "15": " And I will endeavour, that you frequently have after my decease, whereby you may keep a memory of these things. \n", "16": " For we have not by following artificial fables, made known to you the power, and presence of our Lord Jesus Christ; but we were eyewitnesses of his greatness. \n", "17": " For he received from God the Father, honour and glory: this voice coming down to him from the excellent glory: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. \n", "18": " And this voice we heard brought from heaven, when we were with him in the holy mount. \n", "19": " And we have the more firm prophetical word: whereunto you do well to attend, as to a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts: \n", "20": " Understanding this first, that <u>no prophecy of scripture is made by private interpretation</u>. \n", "21": " For prophecy came not by the will of man at any time: but the holy men of God spoke, inspired by the Holy Ghost. \n"}}

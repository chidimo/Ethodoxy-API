{"2 Timothy__03": {"1": " Know also this, that, in the last days, shall come dangerous times. \n", "2": " Men shall be lovers of themselves, covetous, haughty, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, wicked, \n", "3": " Without affection, without peace, slanderers, incontinent, unmerciful, without kindness, \n", "4": " Traitors, stubborn, puffed up, and lovers of pleasures more than of God: \n", "5": " Having an appearance indeed of godliness, but denying the power thereof. Now these avoid. \n", "6": " For of these sort are they who creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, who are led away with divers desires: \n", "7": " Ever learning, and never attaining to the knowledge of the truth. \n", "8": " Now as <u>Jannes and Mambres</u> resisted Moses, so these also resist the truth, men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith. \n", "9": " But they shall proceed no farther; for their folly shall be manifest to all men, as theirs also was. \n", "10": " But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, patience, \n", "11": " Persecutions, afflictions: such as came upon me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra: what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord delivered me. \n", "12": " And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution. \n", "13": " But evil men and seducers shall grow worse and worse: erring, and driving into error. \n", "14": " But continue thou in those things which thou hast learned, and which have been committed to thee: knowing of whom thou hast learned them; \n", "15": " And because from thy infancy thou hast known the holy scriptures, which can instruct thee to salvation, by the faith which is in Christ Jesus. \n", "16": " <u>All scripture</u>, inspired of God, is profitable to teach, to reprove, to correct, to instruct in justice, \n", "17": " That the man of God may be perfect, furnished to every good work. \n"}}

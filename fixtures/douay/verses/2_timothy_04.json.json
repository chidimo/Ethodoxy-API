{"2 Timothy__04": {"1": " I charge thee, before God and Jesus Christ, who shall judge the living and the dead, by his coming, and his kingdom: \n", "2": " Preach the word: be instant in season, out of season: reprove, entreat, rebuke in all patience and doctrine. \n", "3": " For there shall be a time, when they will not endure sound doctrine; but, according to their own desires, they will heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears: \n", "4": " And will indeed turn away their hearing from the truth, but will be turned unto fables. \n", "5": " But be thou vigilant, labour in all things, do the work of <u>an evangelist</u>, fulfill thy ministry. Be sober. \n", "6": " For I am even now ready to be sacrificed: and the time of my dissolution is at hand. \n", "7": " I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith. \n", "8": " As to the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of justice, which the Lord the just judge will render to me in that day: and not only to me, but to them also that love his coming. Make haste to come to me quickly. \n", "9": " For Demas hath left me, loving this world, and is gone to Thessalonica: \n", "10": " Crescens into Galatia, Titus into Dalmatia. \n", "11": " Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry. \n", "12": " But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus. \n", "13": " The cloak that I left at Troas, with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, especially the parchments. \n", "14": " Alexander the coppersmith hath done me much evil: the Lord will reward him according to his works: \n", "15": " Whom do thou also avoid, for he hath greatly withstood our words. \n", "16": " At my first answer no man stood with me, but all forsook me: may it not be laid to their charge. \n", "17": " But the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that by me the preaching may be accomplished, and that all the Gentiles may hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. \n", "18": " The Lord hath delivered me from every evil work: and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen. \n", "19": " Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus. \n", "20": " Erastus remained at Corinth. And Trophimus I left sick at Miletus. \n", "21": " Make haste to come before winter. Eubulus and Pudens, and Linus and Claudia, and all the brethren, salute thee. \n", "22": " The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen. \n"}}

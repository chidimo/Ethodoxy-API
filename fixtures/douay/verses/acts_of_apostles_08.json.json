{"Acts of Apostles__08": {"1": " And at that time there was raised a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all dispersed through the countries of Judea, and Samaria, except the apostles. \n", "2": " And devout men took order for Stephen's funeral, and made great mourning over him. \n", "3": " But Saul made havock of the church, entering in from house to house, and dragging away men and women, committed them to prison. \n", "4": " They therefore that were dispersed, went about preaching the word of God. \n", "5": " And Philip going down to the city of Samaria, preached Christ unto them. \n", "6": " And the people with one accord were attentive to those things which were said by Philip, hearing, and seeing the miracles which he did. \n", "7": " For many of them who had unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, went out. \n", "8": " And many, taken with the palsy, and that were lame, were healed. \n", "9": " There was therefore great joy in that city. Now there was a certain man named Simon, who before had been a magician in that city, seducing the people of Samaria, giving out that he was some great one: \n", "10": " To whom they all gave ear, from the least to the greatest, saying: This man is the power of God, which is called great. \n", "11": " And they were attentive to him, because, for a long time, he had bewitched them with his magical practices. \n", "12": " But when they had believed Philip preaching of the kingdom of God, in the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. \n", "13": " Then Simon himself believed also; and being baptized, he adhered to Philip. And being astonished, wondered to see the signs and exceeding great miracles which were done. \n", "14": " Now when the apostles, who were in Jerusalem, had heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John. \n", "15": " Who, when they were come, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost. \n", "16": " For he was not as yet come upon any of them; but they were only baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. \n", "17": " Then <u>they laid their hands upon them</u>, and they received the Holy Ghost. \n", "18": " And when Simon saw, that by the imposition of the hands of the apostles, the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, \n", "19": " Saying: Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I shall lay my hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. But Peter said to him: \n", "20": " Keep thy money to thyself, to perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. \n", "21": " Thou hast no part nor lot in this matter. For thy heart is not right in the sight of God. \n", "22": " Do penance therefore for this thy wickedness; and pray to God, that perhaps this thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee. \n", "23": " For I see thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bonds of iniquity. \n", "24": " Then Simon answering, said: Pray you for me to the Lord, that none of these things which you have spoken may come upon me. \n", "25": " And they indeed having testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel to many countries of the Samaritans. \n", "26": " Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying: Arise, go towards the south, to the way that goeth down from Jerusalem into Gaza: this is desert. \n", "27": " And rising up, he went. And behold a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch, of great authority under Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who had charge over all her treasures, had come to Jerusalem to adore. \n", "28": " And he was returning, sitting in his chariot, and reading Isaias the prophet. \n", "29": " And the Spirit said to Philip: Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. \n", "30": " And Philip running thither, heard him reading the prophet Isaias. And he said: Thinkest thou that thou understandest what thou readest? \n", "31": " Who said: And how can I, unless some man shew me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him. \n", "32": " And the place of the scripture which he was reading was this: He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb without voice before his shearer, so openeth he not his mouth. \n", "33": " In humility his judgment was taken away. His generation who shall declare, for his life shall be taken from the earth? \n", "34": " And the eunuch answering Philip, said: I beseech thee, of whom doth the prophet speak this? of himself, or of some other man? \n", "35": " Then Philip, opening his mouth, and beginning at this scripture, preached unto him Jesus. \n", "36": " And as they went on their way, they came to a certain water; and the eunuch said: See, here is water: what doth hinder me from being baptized? \n", "37": " And Philip said: <u>If thou believest with all thy heart</u>, thou mayest. And he answering, said: I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. \n", "38": " And he commanded the chariot to stand still; and they went down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch: and he baptized him. \n", "39": " And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took away Philip; and the eunuch saw him no more. And he went on his way rejoicing. \n", "40": " But Philip was found in Azotus; and passing through, he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Caesarea. \n"}}

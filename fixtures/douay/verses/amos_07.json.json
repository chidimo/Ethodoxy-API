{"Amos__07": {"1": " These things the Lord God shewed to me: and behold <u>the locust</u> was formed in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter rain, and lo, it was the latter rain after the king's mowing. \n", "2": " And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating the grass of the land, I said: O Lord God, be merciful, I beseech thee: who shall raise up Jacob, for he is very little? \n", "3": " The Lord had pity upon this: It shall not be, said the Lord. \n", "4": " These things the Lord God shewed to me: and behold the Lord called for judgment unto fire, and it devoured the great deep, and ate up a part at the same time. \n", "5": " And I said: O Lord God, cease, I beseech thee, who shall raise up Jacob, for he is a little one? \n", "6": " The Lord had pity upon this. Yea this also shall not be, said the Lord God. \n", "7": " These things the Lord shewed to me: and behold the Lord was standing upon a plastered wall, and in his hand a mason's trowel. \n", "8": " And the Lord said to me: What seest thou, Amos? And I said: A mason's trowel. And the Lord said: Behold, I will lay down the trowel in the midst of my people Israel. I will plaster them over no more. \n", "9": " And the high places of the idol shall be thrown down, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste: and I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with the sword. \n", "10": " And Amasias the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying: Amos hath rebelled against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words. \n", "11": " For thus saith Amos: <u>Jeroboam shall die by the sword</u>, and Israel shall be carried away captive out of their own land. \n", "12": " And Amasias said to Amos: Thou seer, go, flee away into the land of Juda: and eat bread there, and prophesy there. \n", "13": " But prophesy not again any more in Bethel: because it is the king's sanctuary, and it is the house of the kingdom. \n", "14": " And Amos answered and said to Amasias: <u>I am not a prophet</u>, nor am I the son of a prophet: but I am a herdsman plucking wild figs. \n", "15": " And the Lord took me when I followed the flock, and the Lord said to me: Go, prophesy to my people Israel. \n", "16": " And now hear thou the word of the Lord: Thou sayest, thou shalt not prophesy against Israel, and thou shalt not drop thy word upon <u>the house of the idol</u>. \n", "17": " Therefore thus saith the Lord: Thy wife shall play the harlot in the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy land shall be measured by a line: and thou shalt die in a polluted land, and Israel shall go into captivity out of their land. \n"}}

{"Amos__09": {"1": " I saw the Lord standing upon the altar, and he said: Strike the hinges, and let the lintels be shook: for there is covetousness in the head of them all, and I will slay the last of them with the sword: there shall be no flight for them: they shall flee, and he that shall flee of them shall not be delivered. \n", "2": " Though they go down even to hell, thence shall my hand bring them out: and though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down. \n", "3": " And though they be hid in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them away from thence: and though they hide themselves from my eyes in the depth of the sea, there will I command the serpent and he shall bite them. \n", "4": " And if they go into captivity before their enemies, there will I command the sword, and it shall kill them. And I will set my eyes upon them for evil, and not for good. \n", "5": " And the Lord the God of hosts is he who toucheth the earth, and it shall melt: and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall rise up as a river, and shall run down as the river of Egypt. \n", "6": " He that buildeth <u>his ascension</u> in heaven, and hath founded <u>his bundle</u> upon the earth: who calleth the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth, the Lord is his name. \n", "7": " Are not you <u>as the children of the Ethiopians</u> unto me, O children of Israel, saith the Lord? did not I bring up Israel, out of the land of Egypt: and the Philistines out of Cappadocia, and the Syrians out of Cyrene? \n", "8": " Behold the eyes of the Lord God are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from the face of the earth: but yet I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the Lord. \n", "9": " For behold I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, as corn is sifted in a sieve: and there shall not a little stone fall to the ground. \n", "10": " All the sinners of my people shall fall by the sword: who say: The evils shall not approach, and shall not come upon us. \n", "11": " In that day I will raise up the tabernacle of David, that is fallen: and I will close up the breaches of the walls thereof, and repair what was fallen: and I will rebuild it as in the days of old. \n", "12": " That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and all nations, because my name is invoked upon them: saith the Lord that doth these things. \n", "13": " Behold the days come, saith the Lord, when the ploughman <u>shall overtake</u> the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed: and the mountains shall drop sweetness, and every hill shall be tilled. \n", "14": " And I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel: and they shall build the abandoned cities, and inhabit them: and they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine of them: and shall make gardens, and eat the fruits of them. And I will plant them upon their own land: and I will no more pluck them out of their land which I have given them, saith the Lord thy God. \n"}}

{"Apocalypse / Revelation__10": {"1": " And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow was on his head, and his face was as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire. \n", "2": " And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot upon the earth. \n", "3": " And he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roareth. And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. \n", "4": " And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying to me: Seal up the things which the seven thunders have spoken; and write them not. \n", "5": " And the angel, whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the earth, lifted up his hand to heaven, \n", "6": " And he swore by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things which are therein; and the earth, and the things which are in it; and the sea, and the things which are therein: That time shall be no longer. \n", "7": " But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound the trumpet, the mystery of God shall be finished, as he hath <u>declared</u> by his servants the prophets. \n", "8": " And I heard a voice from heaven again speaking to me, and saying: Go, and take the book that is open, from the hand of the angel who standeth upon the sea, and upon the earth. \n", "9": " And I went to the angel, saying unto him, that he should give me the book. And he said to me: Take the book, and eat it up: and it shall make thy belly bitter, but in thy mouth it shall be sweet as honey. \n", "10": " And I took the book from the hand of the angel, and ate it up: and it was in my mouth, sweet as honey: and when I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. \n", "11": " And he said to me: Thou must prophesy again to many nations, and peoples, and tongues, and kings. \n"}}

{"Apocalypse / Revelation__12": {"1": " And a great sign appeared in heaven: <u>A woman</u> clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars: \n", "2": " And being with child, she cried travailing in birth, and was in pain to be delivered. \n", "3": " And there was seen another sign in heaven: and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads, and ten horns: and on his head seven diadems: \n", "4": " And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to be delivered; that, when she should be delivered, he might devour her son. \n", "5": " And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with an iron rod: and her son was taken up to God, and to his throne. \n", "6": " And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she had a place prepared by God, that there they should feed her a thousand two hundred sixty days. \n", "7": " And there was a great battle in heaven, Michael and his angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon fought and his angels: \n", "8": " And they prevailed not, neither was their place found any more in heaven. \n", "9": " And that great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, who seduceth the whole world; and he was cast unto the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. \n", "10": " And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying: Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: because the accuser of our brethren is cast forth, who accused them before our God day and night. \n", "11": " And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of the testimony, and they loved not their lives unto death. \n", "12": " Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you that dwell therein. Woe to the earth, and to the sea, because the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, knowing that he hath but a short time. \n", "13": " And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman, who brought forth the man child: \n", "14": " And there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the desert unto her place, where she is nourished for a time and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. \n", "15": " And the serpent cast out of his mouth after the woman, water as it were a river; that he might cause her to be carried away by the river. \n", "16": " And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the river, which the dragon cast out of his mouth. \n", "17": " And the dragon was angry against the woman: and went to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. \n", "18": " And he stood upon the sand of the sea. \n"}}

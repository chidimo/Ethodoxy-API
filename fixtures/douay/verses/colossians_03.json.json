{"Colossians__03": {"1": " Therefore, if you be risen with Christ, seek the things that are above; where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God: \n", "2": " Mind the things that are above, not the things that are upon the earth. \n", "3": " For you are dead; and your life is hid with Christ in God. \n", "4": " When Christ shall appear, who is your life, then you also shall appear with him in glory. \n", "5": " Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, lust, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is the service of idols. \n", "6": " For which things the wrath of God cometh upon the children of unbelief, \n", "7": " In which you also walked some time, when you lived in them. \n", "8": " But now put you also all away: anger, indignation, malice, blasphemy, filthy speech out of your mouth. \n", "9": " Lie not one to another: stripping yourselves of the old man with his deeds, \n", "10": " And putting on the new, him who is renewed unto knowledge, according to the image of him that created him. \n", "11": " Where there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian nor Scythian, bond nor free. But Christ is all, and in all. \n", "12": " Put ye on therefore, as the elect of God, holy, and beloved, the bowels of mercy, benignity, humility, modesty, patience: \n", "13": " Bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if any have a complaint against another: even as the Lord hath forgiven you, so do you also. \n", "14": " But above all these things have charity, which is the bond of perfection: \n", "15": " And let the peace of Christ rejoice in your hearts, wherein also you are called in one body: and be ye thankful. \n", "16": " Let the word of Christ dwell in you abundantly, in all wisdom: teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual canticles, singing in grace in your hearts to God. \n", "17": " All whatsoever you do in word or in work, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God and the Father by him. \n", "18": " Wives, be subject to your husbands, as it behoveth in the Lord. \n", "19": " Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter towards them. \n", "20": " Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing to the Lord. \n", "21": " Fathers, provoke not your children to indignation, lest they be discouraged. \n", "22": " Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh, not serving to the eye, as pleasing men, but in simplicity of heart, fearing God. \n", "23": " Whatsoever you do, do it from the heart, as to the Lord, and not to men: \n", "24": " Knowing that you shall receive of the Lord the reward of inheritance. Serve ye the Lord Christ. \n", "25": " For he that doth wrong, shall receive for that which he hath done wrongfully: and there is no respect of persons with God. \n"}}

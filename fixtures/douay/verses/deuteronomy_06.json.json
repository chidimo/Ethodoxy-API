Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and shalt serve him only, and thou shalt swear by his name. \n", "14": " You shall not go after the strange gods of all the nations, that are round about you: \n", "15": " Because the Lord thy God is a jealous God in the midst of thee: lest at any time the wrath of the Lord thy God be kindled against thee, and take thee away from the face of the earth. \n", "16": " Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God, as thou temptedst him in the place of temptation. \n", "17": " Keep the precepts of the Lord thy God, and the testimonies and ceremonies which he hath commanded thee. \n", "18": " And do that which is pleasing and good in the sight of the Lord, that it may be well with thee: and going in thou mayst possess the goodly land, concerning which the Lord swore to thy fathers, \n", "19": " That he would destroy all thy enemies before thee, as he hath spoken. \n", "20": " And when thy son shall ask thee tomorrow, saying: What mean these testimonies, and ceremonies and judgments, which the Lord our God hath commanded us? \n", "21": " Thou shalt say to him: We were bondmen of Pharao in Egypt, and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand. \n", "22": " And he wrought signs and wonders great and very grievous in Egypt against Pharao, and all his house, in our sight, \n", "23": " And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in and give us the land, concerning which he swore to our fathers. \n", "24": " And the Lord commanded that we should do all these ordinances, and should fear the Lord our God, that it might be well with us all the days of our life, as it is at this day. \n", "25": " And he will be merciful to us, if we keep and do all his precepts before the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us. \n"}}

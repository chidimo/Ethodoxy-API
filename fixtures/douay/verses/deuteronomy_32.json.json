I will make the memory of them to cease from among men. \n", "27": " But for the wrath of the enemies I have deferred it: lest perhaps their enemies might be proud, and should say: Our mighty hand, and not the Lord, hath done all these things. \n", "28": " They are a nation without counsel, and without wisdom. \n", "29": " O that they would be wise and would understand, and would provide for their last end. \n", "30": " How should one pursue after a thousand, and two chase ten thousand? Was it not, because their God had sold them, and the Lord had shut them up? \n", "31": " For our God is not as their gods: our enemies themselves are judges. \n", "32": " Their vines are of the vineyard of Sodom, and of the suburbs of Gomorrha: their grapes are grapes of gall, and their clusters most bitter. \n", "33": " Their wine is the gall of dragons, and the venom of asps, which is incurable. \n", "34": " Are not these things stored up with me, and sealed up in my treasures? \n", "35": " Revenge is mine, and I will repay them in due time, that their foot may slide: the day of destruction is at hand, and the time makes haste to come. \n", "36": " The Lord will judge his people, and will have mercy on his servants: he shall see that their hand is weakened, and that they who were shut up have also failed, and they that remained are consumed. \n", "37": " And he shall say: Where are their gods, in whom they trusted? \n", "38": " Of whose victims they ate the fat, and drank the wine of their drink offerings: let them arise and help you, and protect you in your distress. \n", "39": " See ye that I alone am, and there is no other God besides me: I will kill and I will make to live: I will strike, and I will heal, and there is none that can deliver out of my hand. \n", "40": " I will lift up my hand to heaven, and I will say: I live for ever. \n", "41": " If I shall whet my sword as the lightning, and my hand take hold on judgment: I will render vengeance to my enemies, and repay them that hate me. \n", "42": " I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh, of the blood of the slain and of the captivity, of the bare head of the enemies. \n", "43": " Praise his people, ye nations, for he will revenge the blood of his servants: and will render vengeance to their enemies, and he will be merciful to the land of his people. \n", "44": " So Moses came and spoke all the words of this canticle in the ears of the people, and Josue the son of Nun. \n", "45": " And he ended all these words, speaking to all Israel. \n", "46": " And he said to them: Set your hearts on all the words, which I testify to you this day: which you shall command your children to observe and to do, and to fulfill all that is written in this law: \n", "47": " For they are not commanded you in vain, but that every one should live in them, and that doing them you may continue a long time in the land whither you are going over the Jordan to possess it. \n", "48": " And the Lord spoke to Moses the same day, saying: \n", "49": " Go up into this mountain Abarim, (that is to say, of passages,) unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab over against Jericho: and see the land of Chanaan, which I will deliver to the children of Israel to possess, and die thou in the mountain. \n", "50": " When thou art gone up into it thou shalt be gathered to thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount Her, and was gathered to his people: \n", "51": " Because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel, at the waters of contradiction in Cades of the desert of Sin: and you did not sanctify me among the children of Israel. \n", "52": " Thou shalt see the land before thee, which I will give to the children of Israel, but thou shalt not enter into it. \n"}}

{"Ecclesiastes__02": {"1": " I said in my heart: I will go, and abound with delights, and enjoy good things. And I saw that this also was vanity. \n", "2": " Laughter I counted error: and to mirth I said: Why art thou vainly deceived? \n", "3": " I thought in my heart, to withdraw my flesh from wine, that I might turn my mind to wisdom, and might avoid folly, till I might see what was profitable for the children of men: and what they ought to do under the sun, all the days of their life. \n", "4": " I made me great works, I built me houses, and planted vineyards, \n", "5": " I made gardens, and orchards, and set them with trees of all kinds, \n", "6": " And I made me ponds of water, to water therewith the wood of the young trees, \n", "7": " I got me menservants, and maidservants, and had a great family: and herds of oxen, and great flocks of sheep, above all that were before me in Jerusalem: \n", "8": " I heaped together for myself silver and gold, and the wealth of kings, and provinces: I made me singing men, and singing women, and the delights of the sons of men, cups and vessels to serve to pour out wine: \n", "9": " And I surpassed in riches all that were before me in Jerusalem: my wisdom also remained with me. \n", "10": " And whatsoever my eyes desired, I refused them not: and I withheld not my heart from enjoying every pleasure, and delighting itself in the things which I had prepared: and esteemed this my portion, to make use of my own labour. \n", "11": " And when I turned myself to all the works which my hands had wrought, and to the labours wherein I had laboured in vain, I saw in all things vanity, and vexation of mind, and that nothing was lasting under the sun. \n", "12": " I passed further to behold wisdom, and errors and folly, (What is man, said I, that he can follow the King his maker?) \n", "13": " And I saw that wisdom excelled folly, as much as light differeth from darkness. \n", "14": " The eyes of a wise man are in his head: the fool walketh in darkness: and I learned that they were to die both alike. \n", "15": " And I said in my heart: If the death of the fool and mine shall be one, what doth it avail me, that I have applied myself more to the study of wisdom? And speaking with my own mind, I perceived that this also was vanity. \n", "16": " For there shall be no remembrance of the wise no more than of the fool for ever, and the times to come shall cover all things together with oblivion: the learned dieth in like manner as the unlearned. \n", "17": " And therefore I was weary of my life, when I saw that all things under the sun are evil, and all vanity and vexation of spirit. \n", "18": " Again I hated all my application wherewith I had earnestly laboured under the sun, being like to have an heir after me, \n", "19": " Whom I know not whether he will be a wise man or a fool, and he shall have rule over all my labours with which I have laboured and been solicitous: and is there any thing so vain? \n", "20": " Wherefore I left off and my heart renounced labouring any more under the sun. \n", "21": " For when a man laboureth in wisdom, and knowledge, and carefulness, he leaveth what he hath gotten to an idle man: so this also is vanity, and a great evil. \n", "22": " For what profit shall a man have of all his labour, and vexation of spirit, with which he hath been tormented under the sun? \n", "23": " All his days are full of sorrows and miseries, even in the night he doth not rest in mind: and is not this vanity? \n", "24": " Is it not better to eat and drink, and to shew his soul good things of his labours? and this is from the hand of God. \n", "25": " Who shall so feast and abound with delights as I? \n", "26": " God hath given to a man that is good in his sight, wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he hath given vexation, and superfluous care, to heap up and to gather together, and to give it to him that hath pleased God: but this also is vanity, and a fruitless solicitude of the mind. \n"}}

{"Ecclesiastes__05": {"1": " Speak not any thing rashly, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter a word before God. For God is in heaven, and thou upon earth: therefore let thy words be few. \n", "2": " Dreams follow many cares: and in many words shall be found folly. \n", "3": " If thou hast vowed any thing to God, defer not to pay it: for an unfaithful and foolish promise displeaseth him: but whatsoever thou hast vowed, pay it. \n", "4": " And it is much better not to vow, than after a vow not to perform the things promised. \n", "5": " Give not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin: and say not before the angel: There is no providence: lest God be angry at thy words, and destroy all the works of thy hands. \n", "6": " Where there are many dreams, there are many vanities, and words without number: but do thou fear God. \n", "7": " If thou shalt see the oppressions of the poor, and violent judgments, and justice perverted in the province, wonder not at this matter: for he that is high hath another higher, and there are others still higher than these: \n", "8": " Moreover there is the king that reigneth over all the land subject to him. \n", "9": " A covetous man shall not be satisfied with money: and he that loveth riches shall reap no fruit from them: so this also is vanity. \n", "10": " Where there are great riches, there are also many to eat them. And what doth it profit the owner, but that he seeth the riches with his eyes? \n", "11": " Sleep is sweet to a labouring man, whether he eat little or much: but the fulness of the rich will not suffer him to sleep. \n", "12": " There is also another grievous evil, which I have seen under the sun: riches kept to the hurt of the owner. \n", "13": " For they are lost with very great affliction: he hath begotten a son, who shall be in extremity of want. \n", "14": " As he came forth naked from his mother's womb, so shall he return, and shall take nothing away with him of his labour. \n", "15": " A most deplorable evil: as he came, so shall he return. What then doth it profit him that he hath laboured for the wind? \n", "16": " All the days of his life he eateth in darkness, and in many cares, and in misery, and sorrow. \n", "17": " This therefore hath seemed good to me, that a man should eat and drink, and enjoy the fruit of his labour, wherewith he hath laboured under the sun, all the days of his life, which God hath given him: and this is his portion. \n", "18": " And every man to whom God hath given riches, and substance, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to enjoy his portion, and to rejoice of his labour: this is the gift of God. \n", "19": " For he shall not much remember the days of his life, because God entertaineth his heart with delight, \n"}}

{"Ecclesiastes__06": {"1": " There is also another evil, which I have seen under the sun, and that frequent among men: \n", "2": " A man to whom God hath given riches, and substance, and honour, and his soul wanteth nothing of all that he desireth: yet God doth not give him power to eat thereof, but a stranger shall eat it up. This is vanity and a great misery. \n", "3": " If a man beget a hundred children, and live many years, and attain to a great age, and his soul make no use of the goods of his substance, and he be without burial: of this man I pronounce, that the untimely born is better than he. \n", "4": " For he came in vain, and goeth to darkness, and his name shall be wholly forgotten. \n", "5": " He hath not seen the sun, nor known the distance of good and evil: \n", "6": " Although he lived two thousand years, and hath not enjoyed good things: do not all make haste to one place? \n", "7": " All the labour of man is for his mouth, but his soul shall not be filled. \n", "8": " What hath the wise man more than the fool? and what the poor man, but to go thither, where there is life? \n", "9": " Better it is to see what thou mayst desire, than to desire that which thou canst not know. But this also is vanity, and presumption of spirit. \n", "10": " He that shall be, his name is already called: and it is known, that he is man, and cannot contend in judgment with him that is stronger than himself. \n", "11": " There are many words that have much vanity in disputing. \n"}}

{"Ecclesiastes__10": {"1": " Dying flies spoil the sweetness of the ointment. Wisdom and glory is more precious than a small and shortlived folly. \n", "2": " The heart of a wise man is in his right hand, and the heart of a fool is in his left hand. \n", "3": " Yea, and the fool when he walketh in the way, whereas he himself is a fool, esteemeth all men fools. \n", "4": " If the spirit of him that hath power, ascend upon thee, leave not thy place: because care will make the greatest sins to cease. \n", "5": " There is an evil that I have seen under the sun, as it were by an error proceeding from the face of the prince: \n", "6": " A fool set in high dignity, and the rich sitting beneath. \n", "7": " I have seen servants upon horses: and princes walking on the ground as servants. \n", "8": " He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: and he that breaketh a hedge, a serpent shall bite him. \n", "9": " He that removeth stones, shall be hurt by them: and he that cutteth trees, shall be wounded by them. \n", "10": " If the iron be blunt, and be not as before, but be made blunt, with much labour it shall be sharpened: and after industry shall follow wisdom. \n", "11": " If a serpent bite in silence, he is nothing better that backbiteth secretly. \n", "12": " The words of the mouth of a wise man are grace: but the lips of a fool shall throw him down headlong. \n", "13": " The beginning of his words is folly, and the end of his talk is a mischievous error. \n", "14": " A fool multiplieth words. A man cannot tell what hath been before him: and what shall be after him, who can tell him? \n", "15": " The labour of fools shall afflict them that know not how to go to the city. \n", "16": " Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and when the princes eat in the morning. \n", "17": " Blessed is the land, whose king is noble, and whose princes eat in due season for refreshment, and not for riotousness. \n", "18": " By slothfulness a building shall be brought down, and through the weakness of hands, the house shall drop through. \n", "19": " For laughter they make bread, and wine that the living may feast: and all things obey money. \n", "20": " Detract not the king, no not in thy thought; and speak not evil of the rich man in thy private chamber: because even the birds of the air will carry thy voice, and he that hath wings will tell what thou hast said. \n"}}

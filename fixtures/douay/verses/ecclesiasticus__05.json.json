{"Ecclesiasticus *__05": {"1": " Set not thy heart upon unjust possessions, and say not: I have enough to live on: for it shall be of no service in the time of vengeance and darkness. \n", "2": " Follow not in thy strength the desires of thy heart: \n", "3": " And say not: How mighty am I? and who shall bring me under for my deeds? for God will surely take revenge. \n", "4": " Say not: I have sinned, and what harm hath befallen me? for the most High is a patient rewarder. \n", "5": " Be not without fear about sin forgiven, and add not sin upon sin: \n", "6": " And say not: The mercy of the Lord is great, he will have mercy on the multitude of my sins. \n", "7": " For mercy and wrath quickly come from him, and his wrath looketh upon sinners. \n", "8": " Delay not to be converted to the Lord, and defer it not from day to day. \n", "9": " For his wrath shall come on a sudden, and in the time of vengeance he will destroy thee. \n", "10": " Be not anxious for goods unjustly gotten: for they shall not profit thee in the day of calamity and revenge. \n", "11": " Winnow not with every wind, and go not into every way: for so is every sinner proved by a double tongue. \n", "12": " Be steadfast in the way of the Lord, and in the truth of thy judgment, and in knowledge, and let the word of peace and justice keep with thee. \n", "13": " Be meek to hear the word, that thou mayst understand: and return a true answer with wisdom. \n", "14": " If thou have understanding, answer thy neighbour: but if not, let thy hand be upon thy mouth, lest thou be surprised in an unskillful word, and be confounded. \n", "15": " Honour and glory is in the word of the wise, but the tongue of the fool is his ruin. \n", "16": " Be not called a whisperer, and be not taken in thy tongue, and confounded. \n", "17": " For confusion and repentance is upon a thief, and an evil mark of disgrace upon the double tongued, but to the whisperer hatred, and enmity, and reproach. \n", "18": " Justify alike the small and the great. \n"}}

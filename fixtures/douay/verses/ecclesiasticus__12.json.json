{"Ecclesiasticus *__12": {"1": " If thou do good, know to whom thou dost it, and there shall be much thanks for thy good deeds. \n", "2": " Do good to the just, and thou shalt find great recompense: and if not of him, assuredly of the Lord. \n", "3": " For there is no good for him that is always occupied in evil, and that giveth no alms: for the Highest hateth sinners, and hath mercy on the penitent. \n", "4": " Give to the merciful and uphold not the sinner: God will repay vengeance to the ungodly and to sinners, and keep them against the day of vengeance. \n", "5": " Give to the good, and receive not a sinner. \n", "6": " Do good to the humble, and give not to the ungodly: hold back thy bread, and give it not to him, lest thereby he overmaster thee. \n", "7": " For thou shalt receive twice as much evil for all the good thou shalt have done to him: for the Highest also hateth sinners, and will repay vengeance to the ungodly. \n", "8": " A friend shall not be known in prosperity, and an enemy shall not be hidden in adversity. \n", "9": " In the prosperity of a man, his enemies are grieved: and a friend is known in his adversity. \n", "10": " Never trust thy enemy: for as a brass pot his wickedness rusteth: \n", "11": " Though he humble himself and go crouching, yet take good heed and beware of him. \n", "12": " Set him not by thee, neither let him sit on thy right hand, lest he turn into thy place, and seek to take thy seat: and at the last thou acknowledge my words, and be pricked with my sayings. \n", "13": " Who will pity an enchanter struck by a serpent, or any that come near wild beasts? so is it with him that keepeth company with a wicked man, and is involved in his sins. \n", "14": " For an hour he will abide with thee: but if thou begin to decline, he will not endure it. \n", "15": " An enemy speaketh sweetly with his lips, but in his heart he lieth in wait, to throw thee into a pit. \n", "16": " An enemy weepeth with his eyes: but if he find an opportunity he will not be satisfied with blood: \n", "17": " And if evils come upon thee, thou shalt find him there first. \n", "18": " An enemy hath tears in his eyes, and while he pretendeth to help thee, will undermine thy feet. \n", "19": " He will shake his head, and clap his hands, and whisper much, and change his countenance. \n"}}

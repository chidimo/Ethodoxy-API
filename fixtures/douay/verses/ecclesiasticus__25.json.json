{"Ecclesiasticus *__25": {"1": " With three things my spirit is pleased, which are approved before God and men: \n", "2": " The concord of brethren, and the love of neighbours, and man and wife that agree well together. \n", "3": " Three sorts my soul hateth, and I am greatly grieved at their life: \n", "4": " A poor man that is proud: a rich man that is a liar: an old man that is a fool, and doting. \n", "5": " The things that thou hast not gathered in thy youth, how shalt thou find them in thy old age? \n", "6": " O how comely is judgment for a grey head, and for ancients to know counsel! \n", "7": " O how comely is wisdom for the aged, and understanding and counsel to men of honour! \n", "8": " Much experience is the crown of old men, and the fear of God is their glory. \n", "9": " Nine things that are not to be imagined by the heart have I magnified, and the tenth I will utter to men with my tongue. \n", "10": " A man that hath joy of his children: and he that liveth and seeth the fall of his enemies. \n", "11": " Blessed is he. that dwelleth with a wise woman, and that hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not served such as are unworthy of him. \n", "12": " Blessed is he that findeth a true friend, and that declareth justice to an ear that heareth. \n", "13": " How great is he that findeth wisdom and knowledge! but there is none above him that feareth the Lord. \n", "14": " The fear of God hath set itself above all things: \n", "15": " Blessed is the man, to whom it is given to have the fear of God: he that holdeth it, to whom shall he be likened? \n", "16": " The fear of God is the beginning of his love: and the beginning of faith is to be fast joined unto it. \n", "17": " The sadness of the heart is every plague: and the wickedness of a woman is all evil. \n", "18": " And a man will choose any plague, but the plague of the heart: \n", "19": " And any wickedness, but the wickedness of a woman: \n", "20": " And any affliction, but the affliction from them that hate him: \n", "21": " And any revenge, but the revenge of enemies. \n", "22": " There is no head worse than the head of a serpent: \n", "23": " And there is no anger above the anger of a woman.

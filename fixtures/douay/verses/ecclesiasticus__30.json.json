{"Ecclesiasticus *__30": {"1": " He that loveth his son, frequently chastiseth him, that he may rejoice in his latter end, and not grope after the doors of his neighbours. \n", "2": " He that instructeth his son shall be praised in him, and shall glory in him in the midst of them of his household. \n", "3": " He that teacheth his son, maketh his enemy jealous, and in the midst of his friends he shall glory in him. \n", "4": " His father is dead, and he is as if he were not dead: for he hath left one behind him that is like himself. \n", "5": " While he lived he saw and rejoiced in him: and when he died he was not sorrowful, neither was he confounded before his enemies. \n", "6": " For he left behind him a defender of his house against his enemies, and one that will requite kindness to his friends. \n", "7": " For the souls of his sons he shall bind up his wounds, and at every cry his bowels shall be troubled. \n", "8": " A horse not broken becometh stubborn, and a child left to himself will become headstrong. \n", "9": " Give thy son his way, and he shall make thee afraid: play with him, and he shall make thee sorrowful. \n", "10": " Laugh not with him, lest thou have sorrow, and at the last thy teeth be set on edge. \n", "11": " Give him not liberty in his youth, and wink not at his devices. \n", "12": " Bow down his neck while he is young, and beat his sides while he is a child, lest he grow stubborn, and regard thee not, and so be a sorrow of heart to thee. \n", "13": " Instruct thy son, and labour about him, lest his lewd behaviour be an offence to thee. \n", "14": " Better is a poor man who is sound, and strong of constitution, than a rich man who is weak and afflicted with evils. \n", "15": " Health of the soul in holiness of justice, is better then all gold and silver: and a sound body, than immense revenues. \n", "16": " There is no riches above the riches of the health of the body: and there is no pleasure above the joy of the heart. \n", "17": " Better is death than a bitter life: and everlasting rest, than continual sickness. \n", "18": " Good things that are hidden in a mouth that is shut, are as masses of meat set about a grave. \n", "19": " What good shall an offering do to an idol? for it can neither eat, nor smell: \n", "20": " So is he that is persecuted by the Lord, bearing the reward of his iniquity: \n", "21": " He seeth with his eyes, and groaneth, as an eunuch embracing a virgin, and sighing. \n", "22": " Give not up thy soul to sadness, and afflict not thyself in thy own counsel. \n", "23": " The joyfulness of the heart, is the life of a man, and a never failing treasure of holiness: and the joy of a man is length of life. \n", "24": " Have pity on thy own soul, pleasing God, and contain thyself: gather up thy heart in his holiness: and drive away sadness far from thee. \n", "25": " For sadness hath killed many, and there is no profit in it. \n", "26": " Envy and anger shorten a man's days, and pensiveness will bring old age before the time. \n", "27": " A Cheerful and good heart is always feasting: for his banquets are prepared with diligence. \n"}}

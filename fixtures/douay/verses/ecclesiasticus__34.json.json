{"Ecclesiasticus *__34": {"1": " The hopes of a man that is void of understanding are vain and deceitful: and dreams lift up fools. \n", "2": " The man that giveth heed to lying visions, is like to him that catcheth at a shadow, and followeth after the wind. \n", "3": " The vision of dreams is the resemblance of one thing to another: as when a man's likeness is before the face of a man. \n", "4": " What can be made clean by the unclean? and what truth can come from that which is false? \n", "5": " Deceitful divinations and lying omens and the dreams of evildoers, are vanity: \n", "6": " And the heart fancieth as that of a woman in travail: except it be a vision sent forth from the most High, set no thy heart upon them. \n", "7": " For dreams have deceived many, and they have failed that put their trust in them. \n", "8": " The word of the law shall be fulfilled without a lie, and wisdom shall be made plain in the mouth of the faithful. \n", "9": " What doth he know, that hath not been tried? A man that hath much experience, shall think of many things: and he that hath learned many things, shall shew forth understanding. \n", "10": " He that hath no experience, knoweth little: and he that hath been experienced in many things, multiplieth prudence. \n", "11": " He that hath not been tried, what manner of things doth he know? he that hath been surprised, shall abound with subtlety. \n", "12": " I have seen many things by travelling, and many customs of things. \n", "13": " Sometimes I have been in danger of death for these things, and I have been delivered by the grace of God. \n", "14": " The spirit of those that fear God; is sought after, and by his regard shall be blessed. \n", "15": " For their hope is on him that saveth them, and the eyes of God are upon them that love him. \n", "16": " He that feareth the Lord shall tremble at nothing, and shall not be afraid for he is his hope. \n", "17": " The soul of him that feareth the Lord is blessed. \n", "18": " To whom doth he look, and who in his strength? \n", "19": " The eyes of the Lord are upon them that fear him, he is their powerful protector, and strong stay, a defence from the heat, and a cover from the sun at noon, \n", "20": " A preservation from stumbling, and a help from falling; he raiseth up the soul, and enlighteneth the eyes, and giveth health, and life, and blessing. \n", "21": " The offering of him that sacrificeth of a thing wrongfully gotten, is stained, and the mockeries of the unjust are not acceptable. \n", "22": " The Lord is only for them that wait upon him in the way of truth and justice. \n", "23": " The most High approveth not the gifts of the wicked: neither hath he respect to the oblations of the unjust, nor will he be pacified for sins by the multitude of their sacrifices. \n", "24": " He that offereth sacrifice of the goods of the poor, is as one that sacrificeth the son in the presence of his father. \n", "25": " The bread of the needy, is the life of the poor: he that defraudeth them thereof, is a man of blood. \n", "26": " He that taketh away the bread gotten by sweat, is like him that killeth his neighbour. \n", "27": " He that sheddeth blood, and he that defraudeth the labourer of his hire, are brothers. \n", "28": " When one buildeth up, and another pulleth down: what profit have they but the labour? \n", "29": " When one prayeth, and another curseth: whose voice will God hear? \n", "30": " He that washeth himself after touching the dead, if he toucheth him again, what doth his washing avail? \n", "31": " So a man that fasteth for his sins, and doth the same again, what doth his humbling himself profit him? who will hear his prayer? \n"}}

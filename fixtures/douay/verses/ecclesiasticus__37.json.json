{"Ecclesiasticus *__37": {"1": " Every friend will say: I also am his friend: but there is a friend, that is only a friend in name. Is not this a grief even to death? \n", "2": " But a companion and a friend shall be turned to an enemy. \n", "3": " O wicked presumption, whence camest thou to cover the earth with thy malice, and deceitfulness? \n", "4": " There is a companion who rejoiceth with his friend in his joys, but in the time of trouble, he will be against him. \n", "5": " There is a companion who condoleth with his friend for his belly's sake, and he will take up a shield against enemy. \n", "6": " Forget not thy friend in thy mind, and be not unmindful of him in thy riches. \n", "7": " Consult not with him that layeth a snare for thee, and hide thy counsel from them that envy thee. \n", "8": " Every counsellor giveth out counsel, but there is one that is a counsellor for himself. \n", "9": " Beware of a counsellor. And know before what need he hath: for he will devise to his own mind: \n", "10": " Lest he thrust a stake into the ground, and say to thee: \n", "11": " Thy way is good; and then stand on the other side to see what shall befall thee. \n", "12": " Treat not with a man without religion concerning holiness, nor with an unjust man concerning justice, nor with a woman touching her of whom she is jealous, nor with a coward concerning war, nor with a merchant about traffic, nor with a buyer of selling, nor with an envious man of giving thanks, \n", "13": " Nor with the ungodly of piety, nor with the dishonest of honesty, nor with the held labourer of every work, \n", "14": " Nor with him that worketh by the year of the finishing of the year, nor with an idle servant of much business: give no heed to these in any matter of counsel. \n", "15": " But be continually with a holy man, whomsoever thou shalt know to observe the fear of God, \n", "16": " Whose soul is according to thy own soul: and who, when thou shalt stumble in the dark, will be sorry for thee. \n", "17": " And establish within thyself a heart of good counsel: for there is no other thing of more worth to thee than it. \n", "18": " The soul of a holy man discovereth sometimes true things, more than seven watchmen that sit in a high piece to watch. \n", "19": " But above all these things pray to the most High, that he may direct thy way in truth. \n", "20": " In all thy works let the true word go before thee, and steady counsel before every action. \n", "21": " A wicked word shall change the beast: out of which four manner of things arise, good and evil, life and death: and the tongue is continually the ruler of them. There is a man that is subtle and a teacher of many, and yet is unprofitable to his own soul. \n", "22": " A skillful man hath taught many, and is sweet to his own soul. \n", "23": " He that speaketh sophistically, is hateful: he shall be destitute of every thing. \n", "24": " Grace is not given him from the Lord: for he is deprived of all wisdom. \n", "25": " There is a wise man that is wise to his own soul: and the fruit of his understanding is commendable. \n", "26": " A wise man instructeth his own people, and the fruits of his understanding are faithful. \n", "27": " A wise man shall be filled with blessings, and they that see shall praise him. \n", "28": " The life of a man is in the number of his days: but the days of Israel are innumerable. \n", "29": " A wise man shall inherit honour among his people, and his name shall live for ever. \n", "30": " My son, prove thy soul in thy life: and if it be wicked, give it no power: \n", "31": " For all things are not expedient for all, and every kind pleaseth not every soul. \n", "32": " Be not greedy in any feasting, and pour not out thyself upon any meat: \n", "33": " For in many meats there will be sickness, and greediness will turn to choler. \n", "34": " By surfeiting many have perished: but he that is temperate, shall prolong life. \n"}}

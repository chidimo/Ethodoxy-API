{"Ephesians__05": {"1": " Be ye therefore followers of God, as most dear children; \n", "2": " And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath delivered himself for us, an oblation and a sacrifice to God for an odour of sweetness. \n", "3": " But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not so much as be named among you, as becometh saints: \n", "4": " Or obscenity, or foolish talking, or scurrility, which is to no purpose; but rather giving of thanks. \n", "5": " For know you this and understand, that no fornicator, or unclean, or covetous person (which is a serving of idols), hath inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. \n", "6": " Let no man deceive you with vain words. For because of these things cometh the anger of God upon the children of unbelief. \n", "7": " Be ye not therefore partakers with them. \n", "8": " For you were heretofore darkness, but now light in the Lord. Walk then as children of the light. \n", "9": " For the fruit of the light is in all goodness, and justice, and truth; \n", "10": " Proving what is well pleasing to God: \n", "11": " And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them. \n", "12": " For the things that are done by them in secret, it is a shame even to speak of. \n", "13": " But all things that are reproved, are made manifest by the light; for all that is made manifest is light. \n", "14": " Wherefore he saith: Rise thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead: and Christ shall enlighten thee. \n", "15": " See therefore, brethren, how you walk circumspectly: not as unwise, \n", "16": " But as wise: redeeming the time, because the days are evil. \n", "17": " Wherefore become not unwise, but understanding what is the will of God. \n", "18": " And be not drunk with wine, wherein is luxury; but be ye filled with the holy Spirit, \n", "19": " Speaking to yourselves in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual canticles, singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord; \n", "20": " Giving thanks always for all things, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to God and the Father: \n", "21": " Being subject one to another, in the fear of Christ. \n", "22": " Let women be subject to their husbands, as to the Lord: \n", "23": " Because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church. He is the saviour of his body. \n", "24": " Therefore as the <u>church is subject to Christ</u>, so also let the wives be to their husbands in all things. \n", "25": " Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the church, and delivered himself up for it: \n", "26": " That he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water in the word of life: \n", "27": " That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy, and without blemish. \n", "28": " So also ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife, loveth himself. \n", "29": " For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, as also Christ doth the church: \n", "30": " Because we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. \n", "31": " For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh. \n", "32": " This is a great sacrament; but I speak in Christ and in the church. \n", "33": " Nevertheless let every one of you in particular love his wife as himself: and let the wife fear her husband. \n"}}

{"Exodus__37": {"1": " And Beseleel made also the ark of setim wood: it was two cubits and a half in length, and a cubit and a half in breadth, and the height was of one cubit and a half: and he overlaid it with the purest gold within and without. \n", "2": " And he made to it a crown of gold round about, \n", "3": " Casting four rings of gold at the four corners thereof: two rings in one side, and two in the other. \n", "4": " And he made bars of setim wood, which he overlaid with gold, \n", "5": " And he put them into the rings that were at the sides of the ark to carry it. \n", "6": " He made also the propitiatory, that is, the oracle, of the purest gold, two cubits and a half in length, and a cubit and a half in breadth. \n", "7": " Two cherubims also of beaten gold, which he set on the two sides of the propitiatory: \n", "8": " One cherub in the top of one side, and the other cherub in the top of the other side: two cherubims at the two ends of the propitiatory, \n", "9": " Spreading their wings, and covering the propitiatory, and looking one towards the other, and towards it. \n", "10": " He made also the table of setim wood, in length two cubits, and in breadth one cubit, and in height it was a cubit and a half. \n", "11": " And he overlaid it with the finest gold, and he made to it a golden ledge round about. \n", "12": " And to the ledge itself he made a polished crown of gold, of four fingers' breadth, and upon the same another golden crown. \n", "13": " And he cast four rings of gold, which he put in the four corners at each foot of the table, \n", "14": " Over against the crown: and he put the bars into them, that the table might be carried. \n", "15": " And the bars also themselves he made of setim wood, and overlaid them with gold, \n", "16": " And the vessels for the divers uses of the table, dishes, bowls, and cups, and censers of pure gold, wherein the libations are to be offered. \n", "17": " He made also the candlestick of beaten work of the finest gold. From the shaft whereof its branches, its cups, and bowls, and lilies came out: \n", "18": " Six on the two sides: three branches on one side, and three on the other. \n", "19": " Three cups in manner of a nut on each branch, and bowls withal and lilies; and three cups of the fashion of a nut in another branch, and bowls withal and lilies. The work of the six branches that went out from the shaft of the candlestick was equal. \n", "20": " And in the shaft itself were four cups after the manner of a nut, and bowls withal at every one, and lilies: \n", "21": " And bowls under two branches in three places, which together make six branches going out from one shaft. \n", "22": " So both the bowls, and the branches were of the same, all beaten work of the purest gold. \n", "23": " He made also the seven lamps with their snuffers, and the vessels where the snuffings were to be put out, of the purest gold. \n", "24": " The candlestick with all the vessels thereof weighed a talent of gold. \n", "25": " He made also the altar of incense of setim wood, being a cubit on every side foursquare, and in height two cubits: from the corners of which went out horns. \n", "26": " And he overlaid it with the purest gold, with its grate and the sides, and the horns. \n", "27": " And he made to it a crown of gold round about, and two golden rings under the crown at each side, that the bars might be put into them, and the altar be carried. \n", "28": " And the bars themselves he made also of setim wood, and overlaid them with plates of gold. \n", "29": " He compounded also the oil for the ointment of sanctification, and incense of the purest spices, according to the work of a perfumer. \n"}}

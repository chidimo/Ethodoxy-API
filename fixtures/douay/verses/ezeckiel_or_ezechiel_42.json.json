And their doors were toward the north. \n", "5": " Where were the store chambers lower above: because they bore up the galleries, which appeared above out of them from the lower parts, and from the midst of the building. \n", "6": " For they were of three stories, and had not pillars, as the pillars of the courts: therefore did they appear above out of the lower places, and out of the middle places, fifty cubits from the ground. \n", "7": " And the outward wall that went about by the chambers, which were towards the outward court on the forepart of the chambers, was fifty cubits long. \n", "8": " For the length of the chambers of the outward court was fifty cubits: and the length before the face of the temple, a hundred cubits. \n", "9": " And there was under these chambers, an entrance from the east, for them that went into them out of the outward court. \n", "10": " In the breadth of the outward wall of the court that was toward the east, over against the separate building, and there were chambers before the building. \n", "11": " And the way before them was like the chambers which were toward the north: they were as long as they, and as broad as they: and all the going in to them, and their fashions, and their doors were alike. \n", "12": " According to the doors of the chambers that were towards the south: there was a door in the head of the way, which way was before the porch, separated towards the east as one entereth in. \n", "13": " And he said to me: The chambers of the north, and the chambers of the south, which are before the separate building: they are holy chambers, in which the priests shall eat, that approach to the Lord into the holy of holies: there they shall lay the most holy things, and the offering for sin, and for trespass: for it is a holy place. \n", "14": " And when the priests shall have entered in, they shall not go out of the holy places into the outward court: but there they shall lay their vestments, wherein they minister, for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and so they shall go forth to the people. \n", "15": " Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me out by the way of the gate that looked toward the east: and he measured it on every side round about. \n", "16": " And he measured toward the east with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about. \n", "17": " And he measured toward the north five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about. \n", "18": " And towards the south he measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about. \n", "19": " And toward the west he measured five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed. \n", "20": " By the four winds he measured the wall thereof on every side round about, five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits broad, making a separation between the sanctuary and the place of the people. \n"}}

{"Galatians__01": {"1": " Paul, an apostle, not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead, \n", "2": " And all the brethren who are with me, to the churches of Galatia. \n", "3": " Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ, \n", "4": " Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present wicked world, according to the will of God and our Father: \n", "5": " To whom is glory for ever and ever. Amen. \n", "6": " I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ, unto another gospel. \n", "7": " Which is not another, only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. \n", "8": " But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you besides that which we have preached to you, let him be anathema. \n", "9": " As we said before, so now I say again: If any one preach to you a gospel, besides that which you have received, let him be anathema. \n", "10": " For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ. \n", "11": " For I give you to understand, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. \n", "12": " For neither did I receive it of man, nor did I learn it; but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. \n", "13": " For you have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion: how that, beyond measure, I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it. \n", "14": " And I made progress in the Jews' religion above many of my equals in my own nation, being more abundantly zealous for the traditions of my fathers. \n", "15": " But when it pleased him, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace, \n", "16": " To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, immediately I condescended not to flesh and blood. \n", "17": " Neither went I to Jerusalem, to the apostles who were before me: but I went into Arabia, and again I returned to Damascus. \n", "18": " Then, after three years, I went to Jerusalem, to see Peter, and I tarried with him fifteen days. \n", "19": " But other of the apostles I saw none, saving James the brother of the Lord. \n", "20": " Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not. \n", "21": " Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia. \n", "22": " And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, which were in Christ: \n", "23": " But they had heard only: He, who persecuted us in times past, doth now preach the faith which once he impugned: \n", "24": " And they glorified God in me. \n"}}

{"Galatians__04": {"1": " Now I say, as long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; \n", "2": " But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father: \n", "3": " So we also, when we were children, were serving <u>under the elements</u> of the world. \n", "4": " But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent his Son, made of a woman, made under the law: \n", "5": " That he might redeem them who were under the law: that we might receive the adoption of sons. \n", "6": " And because you are sons, God hath sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying: Abba, Father. \n", "7": " Therefore now he is not a servant, but a son. And if a son, an heir also through God. \n", "8": " But then indeed, not knowing God, you served them, who, by nature, are not gods. \n", "9": " But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known by God: how turn you again to the weak and needy elements, which you desire to serve again? \n", "10": " <u>You observe days</u>, and months, and times, and years. \n", "11": " I am afraid of you, lest perhaps I have laboured in vain among you. \n", "12": " Be ye as I, because I also am as you: brethren, I beseech you: you have not injured me at all. \n", "13": " And you know, how through infirmity of the flesh, I preached the gospel to you heretofore: and your temptation in my flesh, \n", "14": " You despised not, nor rejected: but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. \n", "15": " Where is then your blessedness? For I bear you witness, that, if it could be done, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and would have given them to me. \n", "16": " Am I then become your enemy, because I tell you the truth? \n", "17": " They are zealous in your regard not well: but they would exclude you, that you might be zealous for them. \n", "18": " But be zealous for that which is good in a good thing always: and not only when I am present with you. \n", "19": " My little children, of whom I am in labour again, until Christ be formed in you. \n", "20": " And I would willingly be present with you now, and change my voice: because I am ashamed for you. \n", "21": " Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, have you not read the law? \n", "22": " For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by a bondwoman, and the other by a free woman. \n", "23": " But he who was of the bondwoman, was born according to the flesh: but he of the free woman, was by promise. \n", "24": " Which things are said by an allegory. For these are the two testaments. The one from mount Sina, engendering unto bondage; which is Agar: \n", "25": " For Sina is a mountain in Arabia, which hath affinity to that Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children. \n", "26": " But that Jerusalem, which is above, is free: which is our mother. \n", "27": " For it is written: Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not: break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for many are the children of the desolate, more than of her that hath a husband. \n", "28": " Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise. \n", "29": " But as then he, that was born according to the flesh, persecuted him that was after the spirit; so also it is now. \n", "30": " But what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son; for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman. \n", "31": " So then, brethren, we are not the children of the bondwoman, but of the free: by the freedom wherewith Christ has made us free. \n"}}

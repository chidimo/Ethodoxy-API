{"Galatians__05": {"1": " Stand fast, and be not held again under the yoke of bondage. \n", "2": " Behold, I Paul tell you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. \n", "3": " And I testify again to every man circumcising himself, that he is a debtor to the whole law. \n", "4": " You are made void of Christ, you who are justified in the law: you are fallen from grace. \n", "5": " For we in spirit, by faith, wait for the hope of justice. \n", "6": " For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision: but faith that worketh by charity. \n", "7": " You did run well, who hath hindered you, that you should not obey the truth? \n", "8": " This persuasion is not from him that calleth you. \n", "9": " A little leaven corrupteth the whole lump. \n", "10": " I have confidence in you in the Lord: that you will not be of another mind: but he that troubleth you, shall bear the judgment, whosoever he be. \n", "11": " And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? Then is the scandal of the cross made void. \n", "12": " I would they were even cut off, who trouble you. \n", "13": " For you, brethren, have been called unto liberty: only make not liberty an occasion to the flesh, but by charity of the spirit serve one another. \n", "14": " For all the law is fulfilled in one word: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. \n", "15": " But if you bite and devour one another; take heed you be not consumed one of another. \n", "16": " I say then, walk in the spirit, and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh. \n", "17": " For the flesh lusteth against the spirit: and the spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary one to another: so that you do not the things that you would. \n", "18": " But if you are led by the spirit, you are not under the law. \n", "19": " Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are fornication, uncleanness, immodesty, luxury, \n", "20": " Idolatry, witchcrafts, enmities, contentions, emulations, wraths, quarrels, dissensions, sects, \n", "21": " Envies, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like. Of the which I foretell you, as I have foretold to you, that they who do such things shall not obtain the kingdom of God. \n", "22": " But the fruit of the Spirit is, charity, joy, peace, patience, benignity, goodness, longanimity, \n", "23": " Mildness, faith, modesty, continency, chastity. Against such there is no law. \n", "24": " And they that are Christ's, have crucified their flesh, with the vices and concupiscences. \n", "25": " If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. \n", "26": " Let us not be made desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying on another. \n"}}

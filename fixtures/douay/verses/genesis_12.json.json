{"Genesis__12": {"1": " And the Lord said to Abram: Go forth out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and out of thy father's house, and come into the land which I shall shew thee. \n", "2": " And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and magnify thy name, and thou shalt be blessed. \n", "3": " I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee, and IN THEE shall all the kindred of the earth be blessed: \n", "4": " So Abram went out as the Lord had commanded him, and Lot went with him: Abram was seventy-five years old when he went forth from Haran. \n", "5": " And he took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all the substance which they had gathered, and the souls which they had gotten in Haran: and they went out to go into the land of Chanaan. And when they were come into it, \n", "6": " Abram passed through the country into the place of Sichem, as far as the noble vale: now the Chanaanite was at that time in the land. \n", "7": " And the Lord appeared to Abram, and said to him: To thy seed will I give this land. And he built there an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him. \n", "8": " And passing on from thence to a mountain, that was on the east side of Bethel, he there pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east; he built there also an altar to the Lord, and called upon his name. \n", "9": " And Abram went forward, going, and proceeding on to the south. \n", "10": " And there came a famine in the country; and Abram went down into Egypt, to sojourn there: for the famine was very grievous in the land. \n", "11": " And when he was near to enter into Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife: I know that thou art a beautiful woman: \n", "12": " And that when the Egyptians shall see thee, they will say: She is his wife: and they will kill me, and keep thee. \n", "13": " Say, therefore, I pray thee, that thou art <u>my sister</u>: that I may be well used for thee, and that my soul may live for thy sake. \n", "14": " And when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians saw the woman that she was very beautiful. \n", "15": " And the princes told Pharao, and praised her before him: and the woman was taken into the house of Pharao. \n", "16": " And they used Abram well for her sake.

Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife? \n", "19": " For what cause didst thou say, she was thy sister, that I might take her to my wife? Now, therefore, there is thy wife, take her, and go thy way. \n", "20": " And Pharao gave his men orders concerning Abram: and they led him away, and his wife, and all that he had. \n"}}

{"Genesis__20": {"1": " Abraham removed from thence to the south country, and dwelt between Cades and Sur, and sojourned in Gerara. \n", "2": " And he said of Sara his wife: She is my sister. So Abimelech the king of Gerara sent, and took her. \n", "3": " And God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and he said to him: Lo thou shalt die for the woman thou hast taken: for she hath a husband. \n", "4": " Now Abimelech had not touched her, and he said: Lord, wilt thou slay a nation, that is ignorant and just? \n", "5": " Did not he say to me: She is my sister: and she say, He is my brother? in the simplicity of my heart, and cleanness of my hands have I done this. \n", "6": " And God said to him: And I know that thou didst it with a sincere heart: and therefore I withheld thee from sinning against me, and I suffered thee not to touch her. \n", "7": " Now therefore restore the man his wife, for he is a prophet: and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: but if thou wilt not restore her, know that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that are thine. \n", "8": " And Abimelech forthwith rising up in the night, called all his servants: and spoke all these words in their hearing, and all the men were exceedingly afraid. \n", "9": " And Abimelech called also for Abraham, and said to him: What hast thou done to us? what have we offended thee in, that thou hast brought upon me and upon my kingdom a great sin? thou hast done to us what thou oughtest not to do. \n", "10": " And again he expostulated with him, and said, What sawest thou, that thou hast done this? \n", "11": " Abraham answered: I thought with myself, saying: Perhaps there is not the fear of God in this place: and they will kill me for the sake of my wife: \n", "12": " Howbeit, otherwise also she is truly my sister, the daughter of my father, and not the daughter of my mother, and I took her to wife. \n", "13": " And after God brought me out of my father's house, I said to her: Thou shalt do me this kindness: In every place, to which we shall come, thou shalt say that I am thy brother. \n", "14": " And Abimelech took sheep and oxen, and servants and handmaids, and gave to Abraham: and restored to him Sara, his wife. \n", "15": " And said: The land is before you, dwell wheresoever it shall please thee. \n", "16": " And to Sara he said: Behold I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: this shall serve thee for a covering of thy eyes to all that are with thee, and whithersoever thou shalt go: and remember thou wast taken. \n", "17": " And when Abraham prayed, God healed Abimelech and his wife, and his handmaids, and they bore children: \n", "18": " For the Lord had closed up every womb of the house of Abimelech on account of Sara, Abraham's wife. \n"}}

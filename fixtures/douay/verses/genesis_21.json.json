{"Genesis__21": {"1": " And the Lord visited Sara, as he had promised: and fulfilled what he had spoken. \n", "2": " And she conceived and bore a son in her old age, at the time that God had foretold her. \n", "3": " And Abraham called the name of his son, whom Sara bore him, <u>Isaac</u>. \n", "4": " And he circumcised him the eighth day, as God had commanded him, \n", "5": " When he was a hundred years old: for at this age of his father was Isaac born. \n", "6": " And Sara said: God hath made a laughter for me: whosoever shall hear of it will laugh with me. \n", "7": " And again she said: Who would believe that Abraham should hear that Sara gave suck to a son, whom she bore to him in his old age. \n", "8": " And the child grew and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast on the day of his weaning. \n", "9": " And when Sara had seen the son of Agar the Egyptian playing with Isaac her son, she said to Abraham: \n", "10": " Cast out this bondwoman, and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with my son Isaac. \n", "11": " Abraham took this grievously for his son. \n", "12": " And God said to him: Let it not seem grievous to thee for the boy, and for thy bondwoman: in all that Sara hath said to thee, hearken to her voice: for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. \n", "13": " But I will make the son also of the bondwoman a great nation, because he is thy seed. \n", "14": " So Abraham rose up in the morning, and taking bread and a bottle of water, put it upon her shoulder, and delivered the boy, and sent her away. And she departed, and wandered in the wilderness of Bersabee. \n", "15": " And when the water in the bottle was spent, she cast the boy under one of the trees that were there. \n", "16": " And she went her way, and sat over against him a great way off as far as a bow can carry, for she said: I will not see the boy die: and sitting over against, she lifted up her voice and wept. \n", "17": " And God heard the voice of the boy: and an angel of God called to Agar from heaven, saying: What art thou doing, Agar? fear not: for God hath heard the voice of the boy, from the place wherein he is. \n", "18": " Arise, take up the boy, and hold him by the hand: for I will make him a great nation. \n", "19": " And God opened her eyes: and she saw a well of water, and went and filled the bottle, and gave the boy to drink. \n", "20": " And God was with him: and he grew, and dwelt in the wilderness, and became a young man, an archer. \n", "21": " And he dwelt in the wilderness of Pharan, and his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt. \n", "22": " At the same time Abimelech, and Phicol the general of his army said to Abraham: God is with thee in all that thou dost. \n", "23": " Swear therefore by God, that thou wilt not hurt me, nor my posterity, nor my stock: but according to the kindness that I have done to thee, thou shalt do to me, and to the land wherein thou hast lived a stranger. \n", "24": " And Abraham said: I will swear. \n", "25": " And he reproved Abimelech for a well of water, which his servants had taken away by force. \n", "26": " And Abimelech answered: I knew not who did this thing: and thou didst not tell me, and I heard not of it till today. \n", "27": " And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech: and both of them made a league. \n", "28": " And Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs of the flock. \n", "29": " And Abimelech said to him: What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set apart? \n", "30": " But he said: Thou shalt take seven ewe lambs at my hand: that they may be a testimony for me, that I dug this well. \n", "31": " Therefore that place was called <u>Bersabee</u>: because there both of them did swear. \n", "32": " And they made a league for the well of oath. \n", "33": " And Abimelech, and Phicol the general of his army arose and returned to the land of the Palestines. But Abraham planted a grove in Bersabee, and there called upon the name of the Lord God eternal. \n", "34": " And he was a sojourner in the land of the Palestines many days. \n"}}

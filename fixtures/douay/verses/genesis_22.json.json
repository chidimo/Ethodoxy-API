{"Genesis__22": {"1": " After these things, <u>God tempted</u> Abraham, and said to him: Abraham, Abraham. And he answered: Here I am. \n", "2": " He said to him: Take thy only begotten son Isaac, whom thou lovest, and go into the land of vision: and there thou shalt offer him for an holocaust upon one of the mountains which I will shew thee. \n", "3": " So Abraham rising up in the night, saddled his ass: and took with him two young men, and Isaac his son: and when he had cut wood for the holocaust he went his way to the place which God had commanded him. \n", "4": " And on the third day, lifting up his eyes, he saw the place afar off. \n", "5": " And he said to his young men: Stay you here with the ass: I and the boy will go with speed as far as yonder, and after we have worshipped, will return to you. \n", "6": " And he took the wood for the holocaust, and laid it upon Isaac his son: and he himself carried in his hands fire and a sword. And as they two went on together, \n", "7": " Isaac said to his father: My father. And he answered: What wilt thou, son? Behold, saith he, fire and wood: where is the victim for the holocaust? \n", "8": " And Abraham said: God will provide himself a victim for an holocaust, my son. So they went on together. \n", "9": " And they came to the place which God had shewn him, where he built an altar, and laid the wood in order upon it: and when he had bound Isaac his son, he laid him on the altar upon the pile of wood. \n", "10": " And he put forth his hand and took the sword, to sacrifice his son. \n", "11": " And behold an angel of the Lord from heaven called to him, saying: Abraham, Abraham. And he answered: Here I am. \n", "12": " And he said to him: Lay not thy hand upon the boy, neither do thou any thing to him: now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake. \n", "13": " Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw behind his back a ram amongst the briers sticking fast by the horns, which he took and offered for a holocaust instead of his son. \n", "14": " And he called the name of that place, The Lord seeth. Whereupon even to this day it is said: In the mountain the Lord will see. \n", "15": " And the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven, saying: \n", "16": " By my own self have I sworn, saith the Lord: because thou hast done this thing, and hast not spared thy only begotten son for my sake: \n", "17": " I will bless thee, and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is by the sea shore: thy seed shall possess the gates of their enemies. \n", "18": " And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast obeyed my voice. \n", "19": " Abraham returned to his young men, and they went to Bersabee together, and he dwelt there. \n", "20": " After these things, it was told Abraham that Melcha also had borne children to Nachor his brother. \n", "21": " Hus the firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Camuel the father of the Syrians, \n", "22": " And Cased, and Azau, and Pheldas, and Jedlaph, \n", "23": " And Bathuel, of whom was born Rebecca: These eight did Melcha bear to Nachor Abraham's brother. \n", "24": " And his concubine, named Roma, bore Tabee, and Gaham, and Tahas, and Maacha. \n"}}

{"Genesis__37": {"1": " And Jacob dwelt in the land of Chanaan wherein his father sojourned. \n", "2": " And these are his generations: Joseph, when he was sixteen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren, being but a boy: and he was with the sons of Bala and of Zelpha his father's wives: and he accused his brethren to his father of a most wicked crime. \n", "3": " Now Israel loved Joseph above all his sons, because he had him in his old age: and he made him a coat of divers colours. \n", "4": " And his brethren seeing that he was loved by his father, more than all his sons, hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him. \n", "5": " Now it fell out also that he told his brethren <u>a dream</u>, that he had dreamed: which occasioned them to hate him the more. \n", "6": " And he said to them: Hear my dream which I dreamed. \n", "7": " I thought we were binding sheaves in the field: and my sheaf arose as it were, and stood, and your sheaves standing about, bowed down before my sheaf. \n", "8": " His brethren answered: Shalt thou be our king? or shall we be subject to thy dominion? Therefore this matter of his dreams and words ministered nourishment to their envy and hatred. \n", "9": " He dreamed also another dream, which he told his brethren, saying: I saw in a dream, as it were the sun, and the moon, and eleven stars worshipping me. \n", "10": " And when he had told this to his father and brethren, his father rebuked him, and said: What meaneth this dream that thou hast dreamed? shall I and thy mother, and thy brethren <u>worship</u> thee upon the earth? \n", "11": " His brethren therefore envied him: but his father considered the thing with himself. \n", "12": " And when his brethren abode in Sichem feeding their father's flocks, \n", "13": " Israel said to him: Thy brethren feed the sheep in Sichem: come, I will send thee to them. And when he answered: \n", "14": " I am ready: he said to him: Go, and see if all things be well with thy brethren, and the cattle: and bring me word again what is doing. So being sent from the vale of Hebron, he came to Sichem: \n", "15": " And a man found him there wandering in the field, and asked what he sought. \n", "16": " But he answered: I seek my brethren; tell me where they feed the flocks. \n", "17": " And the man said to him: They are departed from this place: for I heard them say: Let us go to Dothain. And Joseph went forward after his brethren, and found them in Dothain. \n", "18": " And when they saw him afar off, before he came nigh them, they thought to kill him. \n", "19": " And said one to another: Behold the dreamer cometh. \n", "20": " Come, let us kill him, and cast him into some old pit: and we will say: Some evil beast hath devoured him: and then it shall appear what his dreams avail him: \n", "21": " And Ruben hearing this, endeavoured to deliver him out of their hands, and said: \n", "22": " Do not take away his life, nor shed his blood: but cast him into this pit, that is in the wilderness, and keep your hands harmless: now he said this, being desirous to deliver him out of their hands and to restore him to his father. \n", "23": " And as soon as he came to his brethren, they forthwith stript him of his outside coat, that was of divers colours: \n", "24": " And cast him into an old pit, where there was no water. \n", "25": " And sitting down to eat bread, they saw some Ismaelites on their way coming from Galaad, with their camels, carrying spices, and balm, and myrrh to Egypt. \n", "26": " And Juda said to his brethren: What will it profit us to kill our brother, and conceal his blood? \n", "27": " It is better that he be sold to the Ismaelites, and that our hands be not defiled: for he is our brother and our flesh. His brethren agreed to his words. \n", "28": " And when the Madianite merchants passed by, they drew him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ismaelites, for twenty pieces of silver: and they led him into Egypt. \n", "29": " And Ruben, returning to the pit, found not the boy: \n", "30": " And rending his garments he went to his brethren, and said: The boy doth not appear and whither shall I go? \n", "31": " And they took his coat, and dipped it in the blood of a kid, which they had killed: \n", "32": " Sending some to carry it to their father, and to say: This we have found: see whether it be thy son's coat, or not. \n", "33": " And the father acknowledging it, said: It is my son's coat, an evil wild beast hath eaten him, a beast hath devoured Joseph. \n", "34": " And tearing his garments, he put on sackcloth, mourning for his son a long time. \n", "35": " And all his children being gathered together to comfort their father in his sorrow, he would not receive comfort, but said: I will go down to my son <u>into hell</u>, mourning. And whilst he continued weeping, \n", "36": " The Madianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Putiphar, <u>an eunuch</u> of Pharao, captain of the soldiers. \n"}}

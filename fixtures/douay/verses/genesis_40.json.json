{"Genesis__40": {"1": " After this, it came to pass, that two eunuchs, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, offended their lord. \n", "2": " And Pharao being angry with them (now the one was chief butler, the other chief baker) \n", "3": " He sent them to the prison of the commander of the soldiers, in which Joseph also was prisoner, \n", "4": " But the keeper of the prison delivered them to Joseph, and he served them. Some little time passed, and they were kept in custody. \n", "5": " And they both dreamed a dream the same night, according to the interpretation agreeing to themselves: \n", "6": " And when Joseph was come in to them in the morning, and saw them sad, \n", "7": " He asked them, saying: Why is your countenance sadder today than usual? \n", "8": " They answered: We have dreamed a dream, and there is nobody to interpret it to us. And Joseph said to them: <u>Doth not interpretation belong to God</u>? Tell me what you have dreamed. \n", "9": " The chief butler first told his dream: I saw before me a vine, \n", "10": " On which were three branches, which by little and little sent out buds, and after the blossoms brought forth ripe grapes: \n", "11": " And the cup of Pharao was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and pressed them into the cup which I held, and I gave the cup to Pharao. \n", "12": " Joseph answered: This is the interpretation of the dream: The three branches are yet three days: \n", "13": " After which Pharao will remember thy service, and will restore thee to thy former place: and thou shalt present him the cup according to thy office, as before thou wast wont to do. \n", "14": " Only remember me, when it shall be well with thee, and do me this kindness: to put Pharao in mind to take me out of this prison: \n", "15": " For I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews, and here without any fault was cast into the dungeon. \n", "16": " The chief baker seeing that he had wisely interpreted the dream, said: I also dreamed a dream, That I had three baskets of meal upon my head: \n", "17": " And that in one basket which was uppermost, I carried all meats that are made by the art of baking, and that the birds ate out of it. \n", "18": " Joseph answered: This is the interpretation of the dream: The three baskets are yet three days: \n", "19": " After which Pharao will take thy head from thee, and hang thee on a cross, and the birds shall tear thy flesh. \n", "20": " The third day after this was the birthday of Pharao: and he made a great feast for his servants, and at the banquet remembered the chief butler, and the chief baker. \n", "21": " And he restored the one to his place to present him the cup: \n", "22": " The other he hanged on a gibbet, that the truth of the interpreter might be shewn. \n", "23": " But the chief butler, when things prospered with him, forgot his interpreter. \n"}}

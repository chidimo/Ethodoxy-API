{"Habakkuk or Habacuc__03": {"1": " A PRAYER OF HABACUC THE PROPHET <u>FOR IGNORANCES</u>. \n", "2": " O Lord, I have heard <u>thy hearing</u>, and was afraid. O Lord, <u>thy work</u>, in the midst of the years bring it to life: In the midst of the years thou shalt make it known: when thou art angry, thou wilt remember mercy. \n", "3": " <u>God will come from the south</u>, and the holy one from mount Pharan: His glory covered the heavens, and the earth is full of his praise. \n", "4": " His brightness shall be as the light; <u>horns</u> are in his hands: There is his strength hid: \n", "5": " <u>Death shall go before his face</u>. And the devil shall go forth before his feet. \n", "6": " He stood and measured the earth. <u>He beheld</u>, and melted the nations: and <u>the ancient mountains</u> were crushed to pieces. The hills of the world were bowed down by the journeys of his eternity. \n", "7": " I saw the tents of <u>Ethiopia</u> for their iniquity, the curtains of the land of Madian shall be troubled. \n", "8": " Wast thou angry, O Lord, <u>with the rivers</u>? or was thy wrath upon the rivers? or thy indignation in the sea? Who will ride upon thy horses: and thy chariots are salvation. \n", "9": " Thou wilt surely take up thy bow: according to the oaths which thou hast spoken to the tribes. Thou wilt divide the rivers of the earth. \n", "10": " The mountains saw thee, and were grieved: the great body of waters passed away. The deep put forth its voice: the deep lifted up its hands. \n", "11": " The sun and the moon stood still in their habitation, in the light of thy arrows, they shall go in the brightness of thy glittering spear. \n", "12": " In thy anger thou wilt tread the earth under foot: in thy wrath thou wilt astonish the nations. \n", "13": " Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people: for salvation with thy Christ. Thou struckest <u>the head of the house of the wicked</u>: thou hast laid bare his foundation even to the neck. \n", "14": " Thou hast cursed his sceptres, the head of his warriors, them that came out as a whirlwind to scatter me. Their joy was like that of him that devoureth the poor man in secret. \n", "15": " <u>Thou madest a way in the sea</u> for thy horses, in the mud of many waters. \n", "16": " <u>I have heard</u> and my bowels were troubled: my lips trembled at the voice. Let rottenness enter into my bones, and swarm under me. That I may rest in the day of tribulation: <u>that I may go up to our people</u> that are girded. \n", "17": " For the fig tree shall not blossom: and there shall be no spring in the vines. The labour of the olive tree shall fail: and the fields shall yield no food: the flock shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls. \n", "18": " But I will rejoice in the Lord: and I will joy in God my Jesus. \n", "19": " The Lord God is my strength: and he will make my feet like the feet of harts: and he the conqueror will lead me upon my high places singing psalms. \n"}}

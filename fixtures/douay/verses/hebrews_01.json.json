{"Hebrews__01": {"1": " God, who, at sundry times and in divers manners, spoke in times past to the fathers by the prophets, last of all, \n", "2": " In these days hath spoken to us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the world. \n", "3": " Who being the brightness of his glory, and <u>the figure</u> of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power, <u>making purgation</u> of sins, sitteth on the right hand of the majesty on high. \n", "4": " Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they. \n", "5": " For to which of the angels hath he said at any time, Thou art my Son, today have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son? \n", "6": " And again, when he bringeth in the first begotten into the world, he saith: And let all the angels of God adore him. \n", "7": " And to the angels indeed he saith: He that maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire. \n", "8": " But to the Son: Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a sceptre of justice is the sceptre of thy kingdom. \n", "9": " Thou hast loved justice, and hated iniquity: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows. \n", "10": " And: Thou in the beginning, O Lord, didst found the earth: and the works of thy hands are the heavens. \n", "11": " They shall perish, but thou shalt continue: and they shall all grow old as a garment. \n", "12": " And as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art the selfsame, and thy years shall not fail. \n", "13": " But to which of the angels said he at any time: Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool? \n", "14": " Are they not all ministering spirits, sent to minister for them, who shall receive the inheritance of salvation? \n"}}

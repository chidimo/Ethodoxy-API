{"Hebrews__08": {"1": " Now of the things which we have spoken, this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of majesty in the heavens, \n", "2": " A minister of <u>the holies</u>, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord hath pitched, and not man. \n", "3": " For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary that he also should have some thing to offer. \n", "4": " <u>If then he were on earth</u>, he would not be a priest: seeing that there would be others to offer gifts according to the law, \n", "5": " <u>Who serve unto</u> the example and shadow of heavenly things. As it was answered to Moses, when he was to finish the tabernacle: See (saith he) that thou make all things according to the pattern which was shewn thee on the mount. \n", "6": " But now he hath obtained a better ministry, by how much also he is a mediator of a better testament, which is established on better promises. \n", "7": " For if that former had been faultless, there should not indeed a place have been sought for a second. \n", "8": " For finding fault with them, he saith: Behold, the days shall come, saith the Lord: and I will perfect unto the house of Israel, and unto the house of Juda, a new testament: \n", "9": " Not according to the testament which I made to their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt: because they continued not in my testament: and I regarded them not, saith the Lord. \n", "10": " For this is the testament which I will make to the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will give my laws into their mind, and in their heart will I write them: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people: \n", "11": " And <u>they shall not teach</u> every man his neighbour and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me from the least to the greatest of them: \n", "12": " Because I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins I will remember no more. \n", "13": " Now in saying <u>a new</u>, he hath made the former old. And that which decayeth and groweth old, is near its end. \n"}}

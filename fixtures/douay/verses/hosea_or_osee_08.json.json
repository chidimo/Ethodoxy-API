{"Hosea or Osee__08": {"1": " Let there be a trumpet in thy throat like an eagle upon the house of the Lord: because they have transgressed my covenant, and have violated my law. \n", "2": " They shall call upon me: O my God, we, Israel, know thee. \n", "3": " Israel hath cast off the thing that is good, the enemy shall pursue him. \n", "4": " They have reigned, but not by me: they have been princes, and I knew not: of their silver, and their gold they have made idols to themselves, that they might perish. \n", "5": " Thy calf, O Samaria, is cast off, my wrath is kindled against them. How long will they be incapable of being cleansed? \n", "6": " For itself also is the invention of Israel: a workman made it, and it is no god: for the calf of Samaria shall be turned to spiders' webs. \n", "7": " For they shall sow wind, and reap a whirlwind, there is no standing stalk in it, the bud shall yield no meal; and if it should yield, strangers shall eat it. \n", "8": " Israel is swallowed up: now is he become among the nations like an unclean vessel. \n", "9": " For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath given gifts to his lovers. \n", "10": " But even though they shall have hired the nations, now will I gather them together: and they shall rest a while from the burden of the king, and the princes. \n", "11": " Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin: altars are become to him unto sin. \n", "12": " I shall write to him my manifold laws, which have been accounted as foreign. \n", "13": " They shall offer victims, they shall sacrifice flesh, and shall eat it, and the Lord will not receive them: now will he remember their iniquity, and will visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt. \n", "14": " And Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and hath built temples: and Juda hath built many fenced cities: and I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the houses thereof. \n"}}

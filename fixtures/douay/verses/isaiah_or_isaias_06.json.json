{"Isaiah or Isaias__06": {"1": " In the year that king Ozias died, I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and elevated: and his train filled the temple. \n", "2": " Upon it stood the seraphims: the one had six wings, and the other had six wings: with two they covered his face, and with two they covered his feet, and with two they flew. \n", "3": " And they cried one to another, and said: Holy, holy, holy, the Lord God of hosts, all the earth is full of his glory. \n", "4": " And the lintels of the doors were moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke. \n", "5": " And I said: Woe is me, because I have held my peace; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people that hath unclean lips, and I have seen with my eyes the King the Lord of hosts. \n", "6": " And one of the seraphims flew to me, and in his hand was a live coal, which he had taken with the tongs off the altar. \n", "7": " And he touched my mouth, and said: Behold this hath touched thy lips, and thy iniquities shall be taken away, and thy sin shall be cleansed. \n", "8": " And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: Whom shall I send? and who shall go for us? And I said: Lo, here am I, send me. \n", "9": " And he said: Go, and thou shalt say to this people: Hearing, hear, and understand not: and see the vision, and know it not. \n", "10": " Blind the heart of this people, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes: lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted and I heal them. \n", "11": " And I said: How long, O Lord? And he said: Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land shall be left desolate. \n", "12": " And the Lord shall remove men far away, and she shall be multiplied that was left in the midst of the earth. \n", "13": " And there shall be still a tithing therein, and she shall turn, and shall be made a shew as a turpentine tree, and as an oak that spreadeth its branches: that which shall stand therein, shall be a holy seed. \n"}}

{"Isaiah or Isaias__09": {"1": " At the first time the land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephtali was lightly touched: and at the last the way of the sea beyond the Jordan of the Galilee of the Gentiles was heavily loaded. \n", "2": " The people that walked in darkness, have seen a great light: to them that dwelt in the region of the shadow of death, light is risen. \n", "3": " Thou hast multiplied the nation, and hast not increased the joy. They shall rejoice before thee, as they that rejoice in the harvest, as conquerors rejoice after taking a prey, when they divide the spoils. \n", "4": " For the yoke of their burden, and the rod of their shoulder, and the sceptre of their oppressor thou hast overcome, as in the day of Median. \n", "5": " For every violent taking of spoils, with tumult, and garment mingled with blood, shall be burnt, and be fuel for the fire. \n", "6": " For a CHILD IS BORN to us, and a son is given to us, and the government is upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called, Wonderful, Counsellor, God the Mighty, the Father of the world to come, the Prince of Peace. \n", "7": " His empire shall be multiplied, and there shall be no end of peace: he shall sit upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom; to establish it and strengthen it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth and for ever: the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this. \n", "8": " The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel. \n", "9": " And all the people of Ephraim shall know, and the inhabitants of Samaria that say in the pride and haughtiness of their heart: \n", "10": " The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with square stones: they have cut down the sycamores, but we will change them for cedars. \n", "11": " And the Lord shall set up the enemies of Rasin over him, and shall bring on his enemies in a crowd: \n", "12": " The Syrians from the east, and the Philistines from the west: and they shall devour Israel with open mouth, For all this his indignation is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. \n", "13": " And the people are not returned to him who hath struck them, and have not sought after the Lord of hosts. \n", "14": " And the Lord shall destroy out of Israel the head and the tail, him that bendeth down, and him that holdeth back, in one day. \n", "15": " The aged and honourable, he is the head: and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail. \n", "16": " And they that call this people blessed, shall cause them to err: and they that are called blessed, shall be thrown down headlong. \n", "17": " Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men: neither shall he have mercy on their fatherless, and widows: for every one is a hypocrite and wicked, and every mouth hath spoken folly. For all this his indignation is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. \n", "18": " For wickedness is kindled as a fire, it shall devour the brier and the thorn: and shall kindle in the thicket of the forest, and it shall be wrapped up in smoke ascending on high. \n", "19": " By the wrath of the Lord of hosts the land is troubled, and the people shall be as fuel for the fire: no man shall spare his brother. \n", "20": " And he shall turn to the right hand, and shall be hungry: and shall eat on the left hand, and shall not be filled: every one shall eat the flesh of his own arm: Manasses Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasses, and they together shall be against Juda. \n", "21": " After all these things his indignation is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. \n"}}

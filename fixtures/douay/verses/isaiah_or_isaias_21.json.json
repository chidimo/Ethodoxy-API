As whirlwinds come from the south, it cometh from the desert from a terrible land. \n", "2": " A grievous vision is told me: he that is unfaithful dealeth unfaithfully: and he that is a spoiler, spoileth. Go up, <u>O Elam</u>, besiege, O Mede: I have made all the mourning thereof to cease. \n", "3": " Therefore are my loins filled with pain, anguish hath taken hold of me, as the anguish of a woman in labour: I fell down at the hearing of it, I was troubled at the seeing of it. \n", "4": " My heart failed, darkness amazed me: Babylon my beloved is become a wonder to me. \n", "5": " Prepare the table, behold in the watchtower them that eat and drink: arise, ye princes, take up the shield. \n", "6": " For thus hath the Lord said to me: Go, and set a watchman: and whatsoever he shall see, let him tell. \n", "7": " And he saw a chariot with two horsemen, <u>a rider upon an ass</u>, and a rider upon a camel: and he beheld them diligently with much heed. \n", "8": " <u>And a lion cried out</u>: I am upon the watchtower of the Lord, standing continually by day: and I am upon my ward, standing whole nights. \n", "9": " Behold this man cometh, the rider upon the chariot with two horsemen, and he answered, and said: Babylon is fallen, she is fallen, and all the graven gods thereof are broken unto the ground. \n", "10": " O my thrashing and the children of my door, that which I have heard of the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, I have declared unto you. \n", "11": " The burden of <u>Duma</u> calleth to me out of Seir: Watchman, what of the eight? watchman, what of the night? \n", "12": " The watchman said: The morning cometh, also the night: if you seek, seek: return, come. \n", "13": " The burden in Arabia.

{"Isaiah or Isaias__25": {"1": " O Lord, thou art my God, I will exalt thee, and give glory to thy name: for thou hast done wonderful things, thy designs of old faithful, amen. \n", "2": " For thou hast reduced the city to a heap, the strong city to ruin, the house of strangers, to be no city, and to be no more built up for ever. \n", "3": " Therefore shall a strong people praise thee, the city of mighty nations shall fear thee. \n", "4": " Because thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress: a refuge from the whirlwind, a shadow from the heat. For the blast of the mighty is like a whirlwind beating against a wall. \n", "5": " Thou shalt bring down the tumult of strangers, as heat in thirst: and as with heat under a burning cloud, thou shalt make the branch of the mighty to wither away. \n", "6": " And the Lord of hosts shall make unto all people in this mountain, a feast of fat things, a feast of wine, of fat things full of marrow, of wine purified from the lees. \n", "7": " And he shall destroy in this mountain the face of the bond with which all people were tied, and the web that he began over all nations. \n", "8": " He shall cast death down headlong for ever: and the Lord God shall wipe away tears from every face, and the reproach of his people he shall take away from off the whole earth: for the Lord hath spoken it. \n", "9": " And they shall say in that day: Lo, this is our God, we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the Lord, we have patiently waited for him, we shall rejoice and be joyfull in his salvation. \n", "10": " For the hand of the Lord shall rest in this mountain: and <u>Moab</u> shall be trodden down under him, as straw is broken in pieces with the wain. \n", "11": " And he shall stretch forth his hands under him, as he that swimmeth stretcheth forth his hands to swim: and he shall bring down his glory with the dashing of his hands. \n", "12": " And the bulwarks of thy high walls shall fall, and be brought low, and shall be pulled down to the ground, even to the dust. \n"}}

He shall bring it down even to the ground, he shall pull it down even to the dust. \n", "6": " The foot shall tread it down, the feet of the poor, the steps of the needy. \n", "7": " The way of the just is right, the path of the just is right to walk in. \n", "8": " And in the way of thy judgments, O Lord, we have patiently waited for thee: thy name, and thy remembrance are the desire of the soul. \n", "9": " My soul hath desired thee in the night: yea, and with my spirit within me in the morning early I will watch to thee. When thou shalt do thy judgments on the earth, the inhabitants of the world shall learn justice. \n", "10": " Let us have pity on the wicked, but he will not learn justice: in the land of the saints he hath done wicked things, and he shall not see the glory of the Lord. \n", "11": " Lord, let thy hand be exalted, and let them not see: let the envious people see, and be confounded: and let fire devour thy enemies. \n", "12": " Lord, thou wilt give us peace: for thou hast wrought all our works for us. \n", "13": " O Lord our God, other lords besides thee have had dominion over us, only in thee let us remember thy name. \n", "14": " Let not the dead live, let not the giants rise again: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and hast destroyed all their memory. \n", "15": " Thou hast been favourable to the nation, O Lord, thou hast been favourable to the nation: art thou glorified? thou hast removed all the ends of the earth far off. \n", "16": " Lord, they have sought after thee in distress, in the tribulation of murmuring thy instruction was with them. \n", "17": " As a woman with child, when she draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs: so are we become in thy presence, O Lord. \n", "18": " We have conceived, and been as it were in labour, and have brought forth wind: we have not wrought salvation on the earth, therefore the inhabitants of the earth have not fallen. \n", "19": " Thy dead men shall live, my slain shall rise again: awake, and give praise, ye that dwell in the dust: for thy dew is the dew of the light: and the land of the giants thou shalt pull down into ruin. \n", "20": " Go, my people, enter into thy chambers, shut thy doors upon thee, hide thyself a little for a moment, until the indignation pass away. \n", "21": " For behold the Lord will come out of his place, to visit the iniquity of the inhabitant of the earth against him: and the earth shall disclose her blood, and <u>shall cover her slain no more</u>. \n"}}

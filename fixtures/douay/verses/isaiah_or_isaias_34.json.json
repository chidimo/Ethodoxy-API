{"Isaiah or Isaias__34": {"1": " Come near, ye Gentiles, and hear, and hearken, ye people: let the earth hear, and all that is therein, the world, and every thing that cometh forth of it. \n", "2": " For the indignation of the Lord if upon all nations, and his fury upon all their armies: he hath killed them, and delivered them to slaughter. \n", "3": " Their slain shall be cast forth, and out of their carcasses shall rise a slink: the mountains shall be melted with their blood. \n", "4": " <u>And all the host of the heavens</u> shall pine away, and the heavens shall be folded together as a book: and all their host shall fall down as the leaf falleth from the vine, and from the fig tree. \n", "5": " For my sword is inebriated in heaven: behold it shall come down upon <u>Idumea</u>, and upon the people of my slaughter unto judgment. \n", "6": " The sword of the Lord is filled with blood, it is made thick with the blood of lambs and buck goats, with the blood of rams full of marrow: for there is a victim of the Lord in Bosra and a great slaughter in the land of Edom. \n", "7": " And <u>the unicorns</u> shall go down with them, and the bulls with the mighty: their land shall be soaked with blood, and their ground with the fat of fat ones. \n", "8": " For it is the day of the vengeance of the Lord, <u>the year of recompenses</u> of the judgment of Sion. \n", "9": " And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the ground thereof into brimstone: and the land thereof shall become burning pitch. \n", "10": " Night and day it shall not be quenched, the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall lie waste, none shall pass through it for ever and ever. \n", "11": " The bittern and ericius shall possess it: and the ibis and the raven shall dwell in it: and a line shall be stretched out upon it, to bring it to nothing, and a plummet, unto desolation. \n", "12": " The nobles thereof shall not be there: they shall call rather upon the king, and all the princes thereof shall be nothing. \n", "13": " And thorns and nettles shall grow up in its houses, and the thistle in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be the habitation of dragons, and the pasture of ostriches. \n", "14": " And demons and monsters shall meet, and the hairy ones shall cry out one to another, there hath the lamia lain down, and found rest for herself. \n", "15": " There hath the ericius had its hole, and brought up its young ones, and hath dug round about, and cherished them in the shadow thereof: thither are the kites gathered together one to another. \n", "16": " Search ye diligently in the book of the Lord, and read: not one of them was wanting, one hath not sought for the other: for that which proceedeth out of my mouth, he hath commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them. \n", "17": " And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it to them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation they shall dwell therein. \n"}}

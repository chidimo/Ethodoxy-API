{"Isaiah or Isaias__35": {"1": " The land that was desolate and impassable shall be glad, and the wilderness shall rejoice, and shall flourish like the lily. \n", "2": " It shall bud forth and blossom, and shall rejoice with joy and praise: the glory of Libanus is given to it: the beauty of Carmel, and Saron, they shall see the glory of the Lord, and the beauty of our God. \n", "3": " Strengthen ye the feeble hands, and confirm the weak knees. \n", "4": " Say to the fainthearted: Take courage, and fear not: behold your God will bring the revenge of recompense: God himself will come and will save you. \n", "5": " Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. \n", "6": " Then shall the lame man leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall be free: for waters are broken out in the desert, and streams in the wilderness. \n", "7": " And that which was dry land, shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water. In the dens where dragons dwell before, shall rise up the verdure of the reed and the bulrush. \n", "8": " And a path and a way shall be there, and it shall be called the holy way: the unclean shall not pass over it, and this shall be unto you a straight way, so that fools shall not err therein. \n", "9": " No lion shall be there, nor shall any mischievous beast go up by it, nor be found there: but they shall walk there that shall be delivered. \n", "10": " And the redeemed of the Lord shall return, and shall come into Sion with praise, and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and mourning shall flee away. \n"}}

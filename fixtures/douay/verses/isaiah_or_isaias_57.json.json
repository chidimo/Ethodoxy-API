{"Isaiah or Isaias__57": {"1": " The just perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart, and men of mercy are taken away, because there is none that understandeth; for the just man is taken away from before the face of evil. \n", "2": " Let peace come, let him rest in his bed that hath walked in his uprightness. \n", "3": " But draw near hither, you sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer, and of the harlot. \n", "4": " Upon whom have you jested? upon whom have you opened your mouth wide, and put out your tongue? are not you wicked children, a false seed, \n", "5": " Who seek your comfort in idols under every green tree, sacrificing children in the torrents, under the high rocks? \n", "6": " In the parts of the torrent is thy portion, this is thy lot: and thou hast poured out libations to them, thou hast offered sacrifice. Shall I not be angry at these things? \n", "7": " Upon a high and lofty mountain thou hast laid thy bed, and hast gone up thither to offer victims. \n", "8": " And behind the door, and behind the post thou hast set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself near me, and hast received an adulterer: thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made a covenant with them: thou hast loved their bed with open hand. \n", "9": " And thou hast adorned thyself for the king with ointment, and hast multiplied thy perfumes. Thou hast sent thy messengers far off, and wast debased even to hell. \n", "10": " Thou hast been wearied in the multitude of thy ways: yet thou saidst not: I will rest: thou hast found life of thy hand, therefore thou hast not asked. \n", "11": " For whom hast thou been solicitous and afraid, that thou hast lied, and hast not been mindful of me, nor thought on me in thy heart? for I am silent, and as one that seeth not, and thou hast forgotten me. \n", "12": " I will declare thy justice, and thy works shall not profit thee. \n", "13": " When thou shalt cry, let thy companies deliver thee, but the wind shall carry them all off, a breeze shall take them away, but he that putteth his trust in me, shall inherit the land, and shall possess my holy mount. \n", "14": " And I will say: Make a way: give free passage, turn out of the path, take away the stumblingblocks out of the way of my people. \n", "15": " For thus saith the High and the Eminent that inhabiteth eternity: and his name is Holy, who dwelleth in the high and holy place, and with a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite. \n", "16": " For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be angry unto the end: because the spirit shall go forth from my face, and breathings I will make. \n", "17": " For the iniquity of his covetousness I was angry, and I struck him: I hid my face from thee, and was angry: and he went away wandering in his own heart. \n", "18": " I saw his ways, and I healed him, and brought him back, and restored comforts to him, and to them that mourn for him. \n", "19": " I created the fruit of the lips, peace, peace to him that is far off, and to him that is near, said the Lord, and I healed him. \n", "20": " But the wicked are like the raging sea, which cannot rest, and the waves thereof cast up dirt and mire. \n", "21": " There is no peace to the wicked, saith the Lord God. \n"}}

{"James__01": {"1": " James the servant of God, and of our Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting. \n", "2": " My brethren, count it all joy, when you shall fall <u>into divers temptations</u>; \n", "3": " Knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience. \n", "4": " And patience hath a perfect work; that you may be perfect and entire, failing in nothing. \n", "5": " But if any of you want wisdom, let him ask of God, who giveth to all men abundantly, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him. \n", "6": " But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, which is moved and carried about by the wind. \n", "7": " Therefore let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord. \n", "8": " A double minded man is inconstant in all his ways. \n", "9": " But let the brother of low condition glory in his exaltation: \n", "10": " And the rich, in his being low; because as the flower of the grass shall he pass away. \n", "11": " For the sun rose with a burning heat, and parched the grass, and the flower thereof fell off, and the beauty of the shape thereof perished: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways. \n", "12": " Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he hath been proved, he shall receive a crown of life, which God hath promised to them that love him. \n", "13": " Let no man, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted by God. For God is not a tempter of evils, and he tempteth no man. \n", "14": " But every man is tempted by his own concupiscence, being drawn away and allured. \n", "15": " Then when concupiscence hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin. But sin, when it is completed, begetteth death. \n", "16": " Do not err, therefore, my dearest brethren. \n", "17": " Every best gift, and every perfect gift, is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change, nor shadow of alteration. \n", "18": " For of his own will hath he begotten us by the word of truth, that we might be <u>some beginning</u> of his creatures. \n", "19": " You know, my dearest brethren. And let every man be swift to hear, but slow to speak, and slow to anger. \n", "20": " For the anger of man worketh not the justice of God. \n", "21": " Wherefore casting away all uncleanness, and abundance of naughtiness, with meekness receive the ingrafted word, which is able to save your souls. \n", "22": " But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. \n", "23": " For if a man be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he shall be compared to a man beholding his own countenance in a glass. \n", "24": " For he beheld himself, and went his way, and presently forgot what manner of man he was. \n", "25": " But he that hath looked into the perfect law of liberty, and hath continued therein, not becoming a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work; this man shall be blessed in his deed. \n", "26": " And if any man think himself to be religious, not bridling his tongue, but deceiving his own heart, this man's religion is vain. \n", "27": " Religion clean and undefiled before God and the Father, is this: to visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation: and to keep one's self unspotted from this world. \n"}}

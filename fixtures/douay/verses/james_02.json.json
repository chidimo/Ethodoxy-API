{"James__02": {"1": " My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ of glory <u>with respect of persons</u>. \n", "2": " For if there shall come into your assembly a man having a golden ring, in fine apparel, and there shall come in also a poor man in mean attire, \n", "3": " And you have respect to him that is clothed with the fine apparel, and shall say to him: Sit thou here well; but say to the poor man: Stand thou there, or sit under my footstool: \n", "4": " Do you not judge within yourselves, and are become judges of unjust thoughts? \n", "5": " Hearken, my dearest brethren: hath not God chosen the poor in this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which God hath promised to them that love him? \n", "6": " But you have dishonoured the poor man. Do not the rich oppress you by might? and do not they draw you before the judgment seats? \n", "7": " Do not they blaspheme the good name that is invoked upon you? \n", "8": " If then you fulfill the royal law, according to the scriptures, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself; you do well. \n", "9": " But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, being reproved by the law as transgressors. \n", "10": " And whosoever shall keep the whole law, but offend in one point, is become <u>guilty of all</u>. \n", "11": " For he that said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also, Thou shalt not kill. Now if thou do not commit adultery, but shalt kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law. \n", "12": " So speak ye, and so do, as being to be judged by the law of liberty. \n", "13": " For judgment without mercy to him that hath not done mercy. And mercy exalteth itself above judgment. \n", "14": " What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not works? Shall faith be able to save him? \n", "15": " And if a brother or sister be naked, and want daily food: \n", "16": " And one of you say to them: Go in peace, be ye warmed and filled; yet give them not those things that are necessary for the body, what shall it profit? \n", "17": " So faith also, if it have not works, is dead in itself. \n", "18": " But some man will say: Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without works; and I will shew thee, by works, my faith. \n", "19": " Thou believest that there is one God. Thou dost well: the devils also believe and tremble. \n", "20": " But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? \n", "21": " Was not Abraham our father justified by works, offering up Isaac his son upon the altar? \n", "22": " Seest thou, that faith did co-operate with his works; and by works faith was made perfect? \n", "23": " And the scripture was fulfilled, saying: Abraham believed God, and it was reputed to him to justice, and he was called the friend of God. \n", "24": " Do you see that by works a man is justified; and not by faith only? \n", "25": " And in like manner also Rahab the harlot, was not she justified by works, receiving the messengers, and sending them out another way? \n", "26": " For even as the body without the spirit is dead; so also faith without works is dead. \n"}}

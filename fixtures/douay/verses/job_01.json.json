{"Job__01": {"1": " There was a man in the land of <u>Hus</u>, whose name was Job, and that man was <u>simple</u> and upright, and fearing God, and avoiding evil. \n", "2": " And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters. \n", "3": " And his possession was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a family exceeding great: and this man was great among all the people of the east. \n", "4": " And his sons went, <u>and made a feast by houses</u> every one in his day. And sending they called their three sisters to eat and drink with them. \n", "5": " And when the days of their feasting were gone about, Job sent to them, and sanctified them: and rising up early offered holocausts for every one of them. For he said: Lest perhaps my sons have sinned, and have <u>blessed</u> God in their hearts. So did Job all days. \n", "6": " Now on a certain day when <u>the sons of God</u> came to stand before the Lord, Satan also was present among them. \n", "7": " And the Lord said to him: Whence comest thou? And he answered and said: I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it. \n", "8": " And the Lord said to him: Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a simple and upright man, and fearing God, and avoiding evil? \n", "9": " And Satan answering, said: Doth Job fear God in vain? \n", "10": " Hast not thou made a fence for him, and his house, and all his substance round about, blessed the works of his hands, and his possession hath increased on the earth? \n", "11": " But stretch forth thy hand a little, and touch all that he hath, and see if he blesseth thee not to thy face. \n", "12": " Then the Lord said to Satan: Behold, all that he hath is in thy hand: only put not forth thy hand upon his person. And Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord. \n", "13": " Now upon a certain day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their eldest brother, \n", "14": " There came a messenger to Job, and said: The oxen were ploughing, and the asses feeding beside them, \n", "15": " And the Sabeans rushed in, and took all away, and slew the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell thee. \n", "16": " And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said: The fire of God fell from heaven, and striking the sheep and the servants, hath consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell thee. \n", "17": " And while he also was yet speaking, there came another, and said: The Chaldeans made three troops, and have fallen upon the camels, and taken them, moreover they have slain the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell thee. \n", "18": " He was yet speaking, and behold another came in, and said: Thy sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their elder brother: \n", "19": " A violent wind came on a sudden from the side of the desert, and shook the four corners of the house, and it fell upon thy children and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to tell thee. \n", "20": " Then Job rose up, and rent his garments, and having shaven his head fell down upon the ground and worshipped, \n", "21": " And said: Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away: as it hath pleased the Lord so is it done: blessed be the name of the Lord. \n", "22": " In all these things Job sinned not by his lips, nor spoke he any foolish thing against God. \n"}}

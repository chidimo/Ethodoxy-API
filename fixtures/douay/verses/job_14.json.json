{"Job__14": {"1": " Man born of a woman, living for a short time, is filled with many miseries. \n", "2": " Who cometh forth like a flower, and is destroyed, and fleeth as a shadow, and never continueth in the same state. \n", "3": " And dost thou think it meet to open thy eyes upon such an one, and to bring him into judgment with thee? \n", "4": " Who can make him clean that is conceived of unclean seed? is it not thou who only art? \n", "5": " The days of man are short, and the number of his months is with thee: thou hast appointed his bounds which cannot be passed. \n", "6": " Depart a little from him, that he may rest, until his wished for day come, as that of the hireling. \n", "7": " A tree hath hope: if it be cut, it groweth green again, and the boughs thereof sprout. \n", "8": " If its root be old in the earth, and its stock be dead in the dust: \n", "9": " At the scent of water, it shall spring, and bring forth leaves, as when it was first planted. \n", "10": " But man when he shall be dead, and stripped and consumed, I pray you where is he? \n", "11": " As if the waters should depart out of the sea, and an emptied river should be dried up: \n", "12": " So man when he is fallen asleep shall not rise again; till the heavens be broken, he shall not awake, nor rise up out of his sleep. \n", "13": " Who will grant me this, <u>that thou mayst protect me in hell</u>, and hide me till thy wrath pass, and appoint me a time when thou wilt remember me? \n", "14": " Shall man that is dead, thinkest thou, live again? all the days in which I am now in warfare, I expect until my change come. \n", "15": " Thou shalt call me, and I will answer thee: to the work of thy hands thou shalt reach out thy right hand. \n", "16": " Thou indeed hast numbered my steps, but spare my sins. \n", "17": " Thou hast sealed up my offences as it were in a bag, but hast cured my iniquity. \n", "18": " A mountain falling cometh to nought, and a rock is removed out of its place. \n", "19": " Waters wear away the stones, and with inundation the ground by little and little is washed away: so in like manner thou shalt destroy man. \n", "20": " Thou hast strengthened him for a little while, that he may pass away for ever: thou shalt change his face, and shalt send him away. \n", "21": " Whether his children come to honour or dishonour, he shall not understand. \n", "22": " But yet his flesh, while he shall live, shall have pain, and his soul shall mourn over him. \n"}}

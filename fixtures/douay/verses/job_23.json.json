{"Job__23": {"1": " Then Job answered, and said: \n", "2": " Now also my words are in bitterness, and the hand of my scourge is more grievous than my mourning. \n", "3": " Who will grant me that I might know and find him, and come even to his throne? \n", "4": " I would set judgment before him, and would fill my mouth with complaints. \n", "5": " That I might know the words that he would answer me, and understand what he would say to me. \n", "6": " I would not that he should contend with me with much strength, nor overwhelm me with the weight of his greatness. \n", "7": " Let him propose equity against me, and let my judgment come to victory. \n", "8": " But if I go to the east, he appeareth not; if to the west, I shall not understand him. \n", "9": " If to the left hand, what shall I do? I shall not take hold on him: if I turn myself to the right hand, I shall not see him. \n", "10": " But he knoweth my way, and has tried me as gold that passeth through the fire: \n", "11": " My foot hath followed his steps, I have kept his way, and have not declined from it. \n", "12": " I have not departed from the commandments of his lips, and the words of his mouth I have hid in my bosom. \n", "13": " For he is alone, and no man can turn away his thought: and whatsoever his soul hath desired, that hath he done. \n", "14": " And when he shall have fulfilled his will in me, many other like things are also at hand with him. \n", "15": " And therefore I am troubled at his presence, and when I consider him I am made pensive with fear. \n", "16": " God hath softened my heart, and the Almighty hath troubled me. \n", "17": " For I have not perished because of the darkness that hangs over me, neither hath the mist covered my face. \n"}}

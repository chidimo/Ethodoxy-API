{"Job__32": {"1": " So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he seemed just to himself. \n", "2": " And Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram, was angry and was moved to indignation: now he was angry against Job, because he said he was just before God. \n", "3": " And he was angry with his friends because they had not found a reasonable answer, but only had condemned Job. \n", "4": " So Eliu waited while Job was speaking, because they were his elders that were speaking. \n", "5": " But when he saw that the three were not able to answer, he was exceedingly angry. \n", "6": " Then Eliu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said: I am younger in days, and you are more ancient; therefore hanging down my head, I was afraid to shew you my opinion. \n", "7": " For I hoped that greater age would speak, and that a multitude of years would teach wisdom. \n", "8": " But, as I see, there is a spirit in men, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth understanding. \n", "9": " They that are aged are not the wise men, neither do the ancients understand judgment. \n", "10": " Therefore I will speak: Hearken to me, I also will shew you my wisdom. \n", "11": " For I have waited for your words, I have given ear to your wisdom, as long as you were disputing in words. \n", "12": " And as long as I thought you said some thing, I considered: but, as I see, there is none of you that can convince Job, and answer his words. \n", "13": " Lest you should say: We have found wisdom, God hath cast him down, not man. \n", "14": " He hath spoken nothing to me, and I will not answer him according to your words. \n", "15": " They were afraid, and answered no more, and they left off speaking. \n", "16": " Therefore because I have waited, and they have not spoken: they stood, and answered no more: \n", "17": " I also will answer my part, and will shew my knowledge. \n", "18": " For I am full of matter to speak of, and the spirit of my bowels straiteneth me. \n", "19": " Behold, my belly is as new wine which wanteth vent, which bursteth the new vessels. \n", "20": " I will speak and take breath a little: I will open my lips, and will answer. \n", "21": " I will not accept the person of man, and <u>I will not level God with man</u>. \n", "22": " For I know not how long I shall continue, and whether after a while my Maker may take me away. \n"}}

{"Job__35": {"1": " Moreover Eliu spoke these words: \n", "2": " Doth thy thought seem right to thee, that thou shouldst say: I am more just than God? \n", "3": " For thou saidst: That which is right doth not please thee: or what will it profit thee if I sin? \n", "4": " Therefore I will answer thy words, and thy friends with thee. \n", "5": " Look up to heaven and see, and behold the sky, that it is higher than thee. \n", "6": " If thou sin, what shalt thou hurt him? and if thy iniquities be multiplied, what shalt thou do against him? \n", "7": " And if thou do justly, what shalt thou give him, or what shall he receive of thy hand? \n", "8": " Thy wickedness may hurt a man that is like thee: and thy justice may help the son of man. \n", "9": " By reason of the multitude of oppressions they shall cry out: and shall wail for the violence of the arm of tyrants. \n", "10": " And he hath not said: Where is God, who made me, who hath given songs in the night? \n", "11": " Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and instructeth us more than the fowls of the air. \n", "12": " There shall they cry, and he will not hear, because of the pride of evil men. \n", "13": " God therefore will not hear in vain, and the Almighty will look into the causes of every one. \n", "14": " Yea when thou shalt say: He considereth not: be judged before him, and expect him. \n", "15": " For he doth not now bring on his fury, neither doth he revenge wickedness exceedingly. \n", "16": " Therefore Job openeth his mouth in vain, and multiplieth words without knowledge. \n"}}

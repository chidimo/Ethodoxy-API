{"Job__41": {"1": " I will not stir him up, like one that is cruel: for who can resist my countenance? \n", "2": " Who hath given me before that I should repay him? All things that are under heaven are mine. \n", "3": " I will not spare him, nor his mighty words, and framed to make supplication. \n", "4": " Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can go into the midst of his mouth? \n", "5": " Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about. \n", "6": " His body is like molten shields, shut close up with scales pressing upon one another. \n", "7": " One is joined to another, and not so much as any air can come between them: \n", "8": " They stick one to another and they hold one another fast, and shall not be separated. \n", "9": " His sneezing is like the shining of fire, and his eyes like the eyelids of the morning. \n", "10": " Out of his mouth go forth lamps, like torches of lighted fire. \n", "11": " Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, like that of a pot heated and boiling. \n", "12": " His breath kindleth coals, and a flame cometh forth out of his mouth. \n", "13": " In his neck strength shall dwell, and want goeth before his face. \n", "14": " The members of his flesh cleave one to another: he shall send lightnings against him, and they shall not be carried to another place. \n", "15": " His heart shall be as hard as a stone, and as firm as a smith's anvil. \n", "16": " When he shall raise him up, the <u>angels</u> shall fear, and being affrighted shall purify themselves. \n", "17": " When a sword shall lay at him, it shall not be able to hold, nor a spear, nor a breastplate. \n", "18": " For he shall esteem iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood. \n", "19": " The archer shall not put him to flight, the stones of the sling are to him like stubble. \n", "20": " As stubble will he esteem the hammer, and he will laugh him to scorn who shaketh the spear. \n", "21": " The beams of the sun shall be <u>under him</u>, and he shall strew gold under him like mire. \n", "22": " He shall make the deep sea to boil like a pot, and shall make it as when ointments boil. \n", "23": " A path shall shine after him, he shall esteem <u>the deep as growing old</u>. \n", "24": " There is no power upon earth that can be compared with him who was made to fear no one. \n", "25": " He beholdeth every high thing, <u>he is king</u> over all the children of pride. \n"}}

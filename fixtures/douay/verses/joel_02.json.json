{"Joel__02": {"1": " Blow ye the trumpet in Sion, sound an alarm in my holy mountain, let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: because <u>the day of the Lord</u> cometh, because it is nigh at hand, \n", "2": " A day of darkness, and of gloominess, a day of clouds and whirlwinds: <u>a numerous and strong people</u> as the morning spread upon the mountains: the like to it hath not been from the beginning, nor shall be after it even to the years of generation and generation. \n", "3": " Before the face thereof a devouring fire, and behind it a burning flame: the land is like a garden of pleasure before it, and behind it a desolate wilderness, neither is there any one that can escape it. \n", "4": " The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses, and they shall run like horsemen. \n", "5": " They shall leap like the noise of chariots upon the tops of mountains, like the noise of a flame of fire devouring the stubble, as a strong people prepared to battle. \n", "6": " At their presence the people shall be in grievous pains: all faces shall be made like a kettle. \n", "7": " They shall run like valiant men: like men of war they shall scale the wall: the men shall march every one on his way, and they shall not turn aside from their ranks. \n", "8": " No one shall press upon his brother: they shall walk every one in his path: yea, and they shall fall through the windows, and shall take no harm. \n", "9": " They shall enter into the city: they shall run upon the wall, they shall climb up the houses, they shall come in at the windows as a thief. \n", "10": " At their presence the earth hath trembled, the heavens are moved: the sun and moon are darkened, and the stars have withdrawn their shining. \n", "11": " And the Lord hath uttered his voice before the face of his army: for his armies are exceeding great, for they are strong and execute his word: for the day of the Lord is great and very terrible: and who can stand it? \n", "12": " Now therefore saith the Lord: Be converted to me with all your heart, in fasting, and in weeping, and in mourning. \n", "13": " And rend your hearts, and not your garments, and turn to the Lord your God: for he is gracious and merciful, patient and rich in mercy, and ready to repent of the evil. \n", "14": " Who knoweth but he will return, and forgive, and leave a blessing behind him, sacrifice and libation to the Lord your God? \n", "15": " Blow the trumpet in Sion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, \n", "16": " Gather together the people, sanctify the church, assemble the ancients, gather together the little ones, and them that suck at the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth from his bed, and the bride out of her bride chamber. \n", "17": " Between the porch and the altar the priests the Lord's ministers shall weep, and shall say: Spare, O Lord, spare thy people: and give not thy inheritance to reproach, that the heathen should rule over them. Why should they say among the nations: Where is their God? \n", "18": " The Lord hath been zealous for his land, and hath spared his people. \n", "19": " And the Lord answered and said to his people: Behold I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and you shall be filled with them: and I will no more make you a reproach among the nations. \n", "20": " And I will remove far off from you <u>the northern enemy</u>: and I will drive him into a land unpassable, and desert, with his face towards the east sea, and his hinder part towards the utmost sea: and his stench shall ascend, and his rottenness shall go up, because he hath done proudly. \n", "21": " Fear not, O land, be glad and rejoice: for the Lord hath done great things. \n", "22": " Fear not, ye beasts of the fields: for the beautiful places of the wilderness are sprung, for the tree hath brought forth its fruit, the fig tree, and the vine have yielded their strength. \n", "23": " And you, O children of Sion, rejoice, and be joyful in the Lord your God: because he hath given you a teacher of justice, and he will make the early and the latter rain to come down to you as in the beginning. \n", "24": " And the floors shall be filled with wheat, and the presses shall overflow with wine and oil. \n", "25": " And I will restore to you the ears which the locust, and the bruchus, and the mildew, and the palmerworm have eaten; my great host which I sent upon you. \n", "26": " And you shall eat in plenty, and shall be filled: and you shall praise the name of the Lord your God, who hath done wonders with you, and my people shall not be confounded for ever. \n", "27": " And you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel: and I am the Lord your God, and there is none besides: and my people shall not be confounded for ever. \n", "28": " And it shall come to pass after this, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy: your old men shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions. \n", "29": " Moreover upon my servants and handmaids in those days I will pour forth my spirit. \n", "30": " And I will shew wonders in heaven; and in earth, blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke. \n", "31": " The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood: before the great and dreadful day of the Lord doth come. \n", "32": " And it shall come to pass, that every one that shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved: for in mount Sion, and in Jerusalem shall be salvation, as the Lord hath said, and in the residue whom the Lord shall call. \n"}}

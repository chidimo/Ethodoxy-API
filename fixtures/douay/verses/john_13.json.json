{"John__13": {"1": " <u>Before the festival day of the pasch</u>, Jesus knowing that his hour was come, that he should pass out of this world to the Father: having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them unto the end. \n", "2": " And when supper was done, (the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to betray him,) \n", "3": " Knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands, and that he came from God, and goeth to God; \n", "4": " He riseth from supper, and layeth aside his garments, and having taken a towel, girded himself. \n", "5": " After that, he putteth water into a basin, and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith he was girded. \n", "6": " He cometh therefore to Simon Peter. And Peter saith to him: Lord, dost thou wash my feet? \n", "7": " Jesus answered, and said to him: What I do thou knowest not now; but thou shalt know hereafter. \n", "8": " Peter saith to him: Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him: If I wash thee not, thou shalt have no part with me. \n", "9": " Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head. \n", "10": " Jesus saith to him: He that is washed, needeth not but to wash his feet, but is clean wholly. And you are clean, but not all. \n", "11": " For he knew who he was that would betray him; therefore he said: You are not all clean. \n", "12": " Then after he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, being set down again, he said to them: Know you what I have done to you? \n", "13": " You call me Master, and Lord; and you say well, for so I am. \n", "14": " If then I being your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; you also ought to wash one another's feet. \n", "15": " For I have given you an example, that as I have done to you, so you do also. \n", "16": " Amen, amen I say to you: The servant is not greater than his lord; neither is the apostle greater than he that sent him. \n", "17": " If you know these things, you shall be blessed if you do them. \n", "18": " I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen. But that the scripture may be fulfilled: He that eateth bread with me, shall lift up his heel against me. \n", "19": " At present I tell you, before it come to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may believe that I am he. \n", "20": " Amen, amen I say to you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send, receiveth me; and he that receiveth me, receiveth him that sent me. \n", "21": " When Jesus had said these things, he was troubled in spirit; and he testified, and said: Amen, amen I say to you, one of you shall betray me. \n", "22": " The disciples therefore looked one upon another, doubting of whom he spoke. \n", "23": " Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved. \n", "24": " Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, and said to him: Who is it of whom he speaketh? \n", "25": " He therefore, leaning on the breast of Jesus, saith to him: Lord, who is it? \n", "26": " Jesus answered: He it is to whom I shall reach bread dipped. And when he had dipped the bread, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon. \n", "27": " And after the morsel, Satan entered into him. And Jesus said to him: <u>That which thou dost, do quickly</u>. \n", "28": " Now no man at the table knew to what purpose he said this unto him. \n", "29": " For some thought, because Judas had the purse, that Jesus had said to him: Buy those things which we have need of for the festival day: or that he should give something to the poor. \n", "30": " He therefore having received the morsel, went out immediately. And it was night. \n", "31": " When he therefore was gone out, Jesus said: Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in him. \n", "32": " If God be glorified in him, God also will glorify him in himself; and immediately will he glorify him. \n", "33": " Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You shall seek me; and as I said to the Jews: Whither I go you cannot come; so I say to you now. \n", "34": " A new commandment I give unto you: That you love one another, as I have loved you, that you also love one another. \n", "35": " By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have love one for another. \n", "36": " Simon Peter saith to him: Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus answered: Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow hereafter. \n", "37": " Peter saith to him: Why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my life for thee. \n", "38": " Jesus answered him: Wilt thou lay down thy life for me? Amen, amen I say to thee, the cock shall not crow, till thou deny me thrice. \n"}}

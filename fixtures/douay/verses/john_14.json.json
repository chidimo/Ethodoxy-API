{"John__14": {"1": " Let not your heart be troubled. You believe in God, believe also in me. \n", "2": " In my Father's house there are many mansions. If not, I would have told you: because I go to prepare a place for you. \n", "3": " And if I shall go, and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will take you to myself; that where I am, you also may be. \n", "4": " And whither I go you know, and the way you know. \n", "5": " Thomas saith to him: Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? \n", "6": " Jesus saith to him: I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No man cometh to the Father, but by me. \n", "7": " If you had known me, you would without doubt have known my Father also: and from henceforth you shall know him, and you have seen him. \n", "8": " Philip saith to him: Lord, shew us the Father, and it is enough for us. \n", "9": " Jesus saith to him: Have I been so long a time with you; and have you not known me? Philip, he that seeth me seeth the Father also. How sayest thou, shew us the Father? \n", "10": " Do you not believe, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? The words that I speak to you, I speak not of myself. But the Father who abideth in me, he doth the works. \n", "11": " Believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? \n", "12": " Otherwise believe for the very works' sake. Amen, amen I say to you, he that believeth in me, the works that I do, he also shall do; and greater than these shall he do. \n", "13": " Because I go to the Father: and whatsoever you shall ask the Father in my name, that will I do: that the Father may be glorified in the Son. \n", "14": " If you shall ask me any thing in my name, that I will do. \n", "15": " If you love me, keep my commandments. \n", "16": " And I will ask the Father, and he shall give you another <u>Paraclete</u>, that he may abide with you <u>for ever</u>. \n", "17": " The spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, nor knoweth him: but you shall know him; because he shall abide with you, and shall be in you. \n", "18": " I will not leave you orphans, I will come to you. \n", "19": " Yet a little while: and the world seeth me no more. But you see me: because I live, and you shall live. \n", "20": " In that day you shall know, that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you. \n", "21": " He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them; he it is that loveth me. And he that loveth me, shall be loved of my Father: and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. \n", "22": " Judas saith to him, not the Iscariot: Lord, how is it, that thou wilt manifest thyself to us, and not to the world? \n", "23": " Jesus answered, and said to him: If any one love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and will make our abode with him. \n", "24": " He that loveth me not, keepeth not my words. And the word which you have heard, is not mine; but the Father's who sent me. \n", "25": " These things have I spoken to you, abiding with you. \n", "26": " But the Paraclete, the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he will <u>teach you all things</u>, and bring all things to your mind, whatsoever I shall have said to you. \n", "27": " Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, do I give unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, nor let it be afraid. \n", "28": " You have heard that I said to you: I go away, and I come unto you. If you loved me, you would indeed be glad, because I go to the Father: <u>for the Father is greater than I</u>. \n", "29": " And now I have told you before it comes to pass: that when it shall come to pass, you may believe. \n", "30": " I will not now speak many things with you. For the prince of this world cometh, and in me he hath not any thing. \n", "31": " But that the world may know, that I love the Father: and as the Father hath given me commandment, so do I: Arise, let us go hence. \n"}}

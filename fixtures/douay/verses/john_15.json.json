{"John__15": {"1": " I am the true vine; and my Father is the husbandman. \n", "2": " Every branch in me, that beareth not fruit, he will take away: and every one that beareth fruit, he will purge it, that it may bring forth more fruit. \n", "3": " Now you are clean by reason of the word, which I have spoken to you. \n", "4": " Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abide in the vine, so neither can you, unless you abide in me. \n", "5": " I am the vine: you the branches: he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for without me you can do nothing. \n", "6": " If any one abide not in me, he shall be cast forth as a branch, and shall wither, and they shall gather him up, and cast him into the fire, and he burneth. \n", "7": " If you abide in me, and my words abide in you, you shall ask whatever you will, and it shall be done unto you. \n", "8": " In this is my Father glorified; that you bring forth very much fruit, and become my disciples. \n", "9": " As the Father hath loved me, I also have loved you. Abide in my love. \n", "10": " If you keep my commandments, you shall abide in my love; as I also have kept my Father's commandments, and do abide in his love. \n", "11": " These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and your joy may be filled. \n", "12": " This is my commandment, that you love one another, as I have loved you. \n", "13": " Greater love than this no man hath, that a man lay down his life for his friends. \n", "14": " You are my friends, if you do the things that I command you. \n", "15": " I will not now call you servants: for the servant knoweth not what his lord doth. But I have called you friends: because all things whatsoever I have heard of my Father, I have made known to you. \n", "16": " You have not chosen me: but I have chosen you; and have appointed you, that you should go, and should bring forth fruit; and your fruit should remain: that whatsoever you shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. \n", "17": " These things I command you, that you love one another. \n", "18": " If the world hate you, know ye, that it hath hated me before you. \n", "19": " If you had been of the world, the world would love its own: but because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. \n", "20": " Remember my word that I said to you: The servant is not greater than his master. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you: if they have kept my word, they will keep yours also. \n", "21": " But all these things they will do to you for my name's sake: because they know not him who sent me. \n", "22": " If I had not come, and spoken to them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin. \n", "23": " He that hateth me, hateth my Father also. \n", "24": " If I had not done among them the works that no other man hath done, they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father. \n", "25": " But that the word may be fulfilled which is written in their law: They hated me without cause. \n", "26": " But when the Paraclete cometh, <u>whom I will send</u> you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, who proceedeth from the Father, he shall give testimony of me. \n", "27": " And you shall give testimony, because you are with me from the beginning. \n"}}

{"John__16": {"1": " These things have I spoken to you, that you may not be scandalized. \n", "2": " They will put you out of the synagogues: yea, the hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you, will think that he doth a service to God. \n", "3": " And these things will they do to you; because they have not known the Father, nor me. \n", "4": " But these things I have told you, that when the hour shall come, you may remember that I told you of them. \n", "5": " But I told you not these things from the beginning, because I was with you. And now I go to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me: Whither goest thou? \n", "6": " But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow hath filled your heart. \n", "7": " But I tell you the truth: it is expedient to you that I go: for if I go not, the Paraclete will not come to you; but if I go, I will send him to you. \n", "8": " And when he is come, <u>he will convict the world of sin</u>, and of justice, and of judgment. \n", "9": " Of sin: because they believed not in me. \n", "10": " And of justice: because I go to the Father; and you shall see me no longer. \n", "11": " And of judgment: because the prince of this world is already judged. \n", "12": " I have yet many things to say to you: but you cannot bear them now. \n", "13": " But when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he <u>will teach you all truth</u>. For he shall not speak of himself; but what things soever he shall hear, he shall speak; and the things that are to come, he shall shew you. \n", "14": " He shall glorify me; because he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it to you. \n", "15": " All things whatsoever the Father hath, are mine. Therefore I said, that he shall receive of mine, and shew it to you. \n", "16": " A little while, and now you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me: because I go to the Father. \n", "17": " Then some of the disciples said one to another: What is this that he saith to us: A little while, and you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me, and, because I go to the Father? \n", "18": " They said therefore: What is this that he saith, A little while? we know not what he speaketh. \n", "19": " And Jesus knew that they had a mind to ask him; and he said to them: Of this do you inquire among yourselves, because I said: A little while, and you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me? \n", "20": " Amen, amen I say to you, that you shall lament and weep, but the world shall rejoice; and you shall be made sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. \n", "21": " A woman, when she is in labour, hath sorrow, because her hour is come; but when she hath brought forth the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world. \n", "22": " So also you now indeed have sorrow; but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice; and your joy no man shall take from you. \n", "23": " And in that day you shall not ask me any thing. Amen, amen I say to you: if you ask the Father any thing in my name, he will give it you. \n", "24": " Hitherto you have not asked any thing in my name. Ask, and you shall receive; that your joy may be full. \n", "25": " These things I have spoken to you in proverbs. The hour cometh, when I will no more speak to you in proverbs, but will shew you plainly of the Father. \n", "26": " In that day you shall ask in my name; and I say not to you, that I will ask the Father for you: \n", "27": " For the Father himself loveth you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God. \n", "28": " I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again I leave the world, and I go to the Father. \n", "29": " His disciples say to him: Behold, now thou speakest plainly, and speakest no proverb. \n", "30": " Now we know that thou knowest all things, and thou needest not that any man should ask thee. By this we believe that thou camest forth from God. \n", "31": " Jesus answered them: Do you now believe? \n", "32": " Behold, the hour cometh, and it is now come, that you shall be scattered every man to his own, and shall leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. \n", "33": " These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you shall have distress: but have confidence, I have overcome the world. \n"}}

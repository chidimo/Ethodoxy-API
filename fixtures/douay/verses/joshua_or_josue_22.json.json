Why have you forsaken the Lord the God of Israel, building a sacrilegious altar, and revolting from the worship of him? \n", "17": " Is it a small thing to you that you sinned with Beelphegor, and the stain of that crime remaineth in us to this day? and many of the people perished. \n", "18": " And you have forsaken the Lord today, and tomorrow his wrath will rage against all Israel. \n", "19": " But if you think the land of your possession to be unclean, pass over to the land wherein is the tabernacle of the Lord, and dwell among us: only depart not from the Lord, and from our society, by building an altar beside the altar of the Lord our God. \n", "20": " Did not Achan the son of Zare transgress the commandment of the Lord, and his wrath lay upon all the people of Israel?

And by this occasion you children shall turn away our children from the fear of the Lord. We therefore thought, it best, \n", "26": " And said: Let us build us an altar, not for holocausts, nor to offer victims, \n", "27": " But for a testimony between us and you, and our posterity and yours, that we may serve the Lord, and that we may have a right to offer both holocausts, and victims and sacrifices of peace offerings: and that your children tomorrow may not say to our children: You have no part in the Lord. \n", "28": " And if they will say so, they shall answer them: Behold the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for holocausts, nor for sacrifice, but for a testimony between us and you. \n", "29": " God keep us from any such wickedness that we should revolt from the Lord, and leave off following his steps, by building an altar to offer holocausts, and sacrifices, and victims, beside the altar of the Lord our God, which is erected before his tabernacle. \n", "30": " And when Phinees the priest, and the princes of the embassage, who were with him, had heard this, they were satisfied: and they admitted most willingly the words of the children of Ruben, and Gad, and of the half tribe of Manasses. \n", "31": " And Phinees the priest the son of Eleazar said to them: Now we know that the Lord is with us, because you are not guilty of this revolt, and you have delivered the children of Israel from the hand of the Lord. \n", "32": " And he returned with the princes from the children of Ruben and Gad, out of the land of Galaad, into the land of Chanaan, to the children of Israel, and brought them word again. \n", "33": " And the saying pleased all that heard it.

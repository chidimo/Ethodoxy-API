And so the victims for sin, and the holocausts, and the peace offerings being finished, he came down. \n", "23": " And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the testimony, and afterwards came forth and blessed the people. And the glory of the Lord appeared to all the multitude: \n", "24": " And behold a fire, coming forth from the Lord, devoured the holocaust, and the fat that was upon the altar: which when the multitude saw, they praised the Lord, falling on their faces. \n"}}

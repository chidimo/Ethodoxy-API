{"Leviticus__22": {"1": " And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying: \n", "2": " Speak to Aaron and to his sons, that they beware of those things that are consecrated of the children of Israel, and defile not the name of the things sanctified to me, which they offer. I am the Lord. \n", "3": " Say to them and to their posterity: Every man of your race, that <u>approacheth</u> to those things that are consecrated, and which the children of Israel have offered to the Lord, in whom there is uncleanness, shall perish before the Lord. I am the Lord. \n", "4": " The man of the seed of Aaron, that is a leper, or that suffereth a running of the seed, shall not eat of those things that are sanctified to me, until he be healed. He that toucheth any thing unclean by occasion of the dead, and he whose seed goeth from him as in generation, \n", "5": " And he that toucheth a creeping thing, or any unclean thing, the touching of which is defiling, \n", "6": " Shall be unclean until the evening, and shall not eat those things that are sanctified: but when he hath washed his flesh with water, \n", "7": " And the sun is down, then being purified, he shall eat of the sanctified things, because it is his meat. \n", "8": " That which dieth of itself, and that which was taken by a beast, they shall not eat, nor be defiled therewith, I am the Lord. \n", "9": " Let them keep my precepts, that they may not fall into sin, and die in the sanctuary, when they shall have defiled it.

{"Luke__19": {"1": " And entering in, he walked through Jericho. \n", "2": " And behold, there was a man named Zacheus, who was the chief of the publicans, and he was rich. \n", "3": " And he sought to see Jesus who he was, and he could not for the crowd, because he was low of stature. \n", "4": " And running before, he climbed up into a sycamore tree, that he might see him; for he was to pass that way. \n", "5": " And when Jesus was come to the place, looking up, he saw him, and said to him: Zacheus, make haste and come down; for this day I must abide in thy house. \n", "6": " And he made haste and came down; and received him with joy. \n", "7": " And when all saw it, they murmured, saying, that he was gone to be a guest with a man that was a sinner. \n", "8": " But Zacheus standing, said to the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have wronged any man of any thing, I restore him fourfold. \n", "9": " Jesus said to him: This day is salvation come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham. \n", "10": " For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost. \n", "11": " As they were hearing these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately be manifested. \n", "12": " He said therefore: A certain nobleman went into a far country, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return. \n", "13": " And calling his ten servants, <u>he gave them ten pounds</u>, and said to them: Trade till I come. \n", "14": " But his citizens hated him: and they sent an embassage after him, saying: We will not have this man to reign over us. \n", "15": " And it came to pass, that he returned, having received the kingdom: and he commanded his servants to be called, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much every man had gained by trading. \n", "16": " And the first came, saying: Lord, thy pound hath gained ten pounds. \n", "17": " And he said to him: Well done, thou good servant, because thou hast been faithful in a little, thou shalt have power over ten cities. \n", "18": " And the second came, saying: Lord, thy pound hath gained five pounds. \n", "19": " And he said to him: Be thou also over five cities. \n", "20": " And another came, saying: Lord, behold here is thy pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin; \n", "21": " For I feared thee, because thou art an austere man: thou takest up what thou didst not lay down, and thou reapest that which thou didst not sow. \n", "22": " He saith to him: Out of thy own mouth I judge thee, thou wicked servant. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up what I laid not down, and reaping that which I did not sow: \n", "23": " And why then didst thou not give my money into the bank, that at my coming, I might have exacted it with usury? \n", "24": " And he said to them that stood by: Take the pound away from him, and give it to him that hath ten pounds. \n", "25": " And they said to him: Lord, he hath ten pounds. \n", "26": " But I say to you, that to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: and from him that hath not, even that which he hath, shall be taken from him. \n", "27": " But as for those my enemies, who would not have me reign over them, bring them hither, and kill them before me. \n", "28": " And having said these things, he went before, going up to Jerusalem. \n", "29": " And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethania, unto the mount called Olivet, he sent two of his disciples, \n", "30": " Saying: Go into the town which is over against you, at your entering into which you shall find the colt of an ass tied, on which no man ever hath sitten: loose him, and bring him hither. \n", "31": " And if any man shall ask you: Why do you loose him? you shall say thus unto him: Because the Lord hath need of his service. \n", "32": " And they that were sent, went their way, and found the colt standing, as he had said unto them. \n", "33": " And as they were loosing the colt, the owners thereof said to them: Why loose you the colt? \n", "34": " But they said: Because the Lord hath need of him. \n", "35": " And they brought him to Jesus. And casting their garments on the colt, they set Jesus thereon. \n", "36": " And as he went, they spread their clothes underneath in the way. \n", "37": " And when he was now coming near the descent of mount Olivet, the whole multitude of his disciples began with joy to praise God with a loud voice, for all the mighty works they had seen, \n", "38": " Saying: Blessed be the king who cometh in the name of the Lord, peace in heaven, and glory on high! \n", "39": " And some of the Pharisees, from amongst the multitude, said to him: Master, rebuke thy disciples. \n", "40": " To whom he said: I say to you, that if these shall hold their peace, the stones will cry out. \n", "41": " And when he drew near, seeing the city, he wept over it, saying: \n", "42": " If thou also hadst known, and that in this thy day, the things that are to thy peace; but now they are hidden from thy eyes. \n", "43": " For the days shall come upon thee, and thy enemies shall cast a trench about thee, and compass thee round, and straiten thee on every side, \n", "44": " And beat thee flat to the ground, and thy children who are in thee: and they shall not leave in thee a stone upon a stone: because thou hast not known the time of thy visitation. \n", "45": " And entering into the temple, he began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought. \n", "46": " Saying to them: It is written: My house is the house of prayer. But you have made it a den of thieves. \n", "47": " And he was teaching daily in the temple. And the chief priests and the scribes and the rulers of the people sought to destroy him: \n", "48": " And they found not what to do to him: for all the people were very attentive to hear him. \n"}}

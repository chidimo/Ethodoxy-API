{"Luke__22": {"1": " Now the feast of unleavened bread, which is called the pasch, was at hand. \n", "2": " And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might put Jesus to death: but they feared the people. \n", "3": " And Satan entered into Judas, who was surnamed Iscariot, one of the twelve. \n", "4": " And he went, and discoursed with the chief priests and the magistrates, how he might betray him to them. \n", "5": " And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money. \n", "6": " And he promised. And he sought opportunity to betray him in the absence of the multitude. \n", "7": " And the day of the unleavened bread came, on which it was necessary that the pasch should be killed. \n", "8": " And he sent Peter and John, saying: Go, and prepare for us the pasch, that we may eat. \n", "9": " But they said: Where wilt thou that we prepare? \n", "10": " And he said to them: Behold, as you go into the city, there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water: follow him into the house where he entereth in. \n", "11": " And you shall say to the goodman of the house: The master saith to thee, Where is the guest chamber, where I may eat the pasch with my disciples? \n", "12": " And he will shew you a large dining room, furnished; and there prepare. \n", "13": " And they going, found as he had said to them, and made ready the pasch. \n", "14": " And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him. \n", "15": " And he said to them: With desire I have desired to eat this pasch with you, before I suffer. \n", "16": " For I say to you, that from this time I will not eat it, till it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. \n", "17": " And having taken the chalice, he gave thanks, and said: Take, and divide it among you: \n", "18": " For I say to you, that I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, till the kingdom of God come. \n", "19": " And taking bread, he gave thanks, and brake; and gave to them, saying: This is my body, which is given for you. <u>Do this for a commemoration of me</u>. \n", "20": " In like manner the chalice also, after he had supped, saying: This is the chalice, the new testament in my blood, which shall be shed for you. \n", "21": " But yet behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table. \n", "22": " And the Son of man indeed goeth, according to that which is determined: but yet, woe to that man by whom he shall be betrayed. \n", "23": " And they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing. \n", "24": " And there was also a strife amongst them, which of them should seem to be the greater. \n", "25": " And he said to them: The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them; and they that have power over them, are called beneficent. \n", "26": " But you not so: but he that is the greater among you, let him become as the younger; and he that is the leader, as he that serveth. \n", "27": " For which is greater, he that sitteth at table, or he that serveth? Is it not he that sitteth at table? But I am in the midst of you, as he that serveth: \n", "28": " And you are they who have continued with me in my temptations: \n", "29": " And I dispose to you, as my Father hath disposed to me, a kingdom; \n", "30": " That you may eat and drink at my table, in my kingdom: and may sit upon thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. \n", "31": " And the Lord said: Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: \n", "32": " But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and thou, being once converted, confirm thy brethren. \n", "33": " Who said to him: Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death. \n", "34": " And he said: I say to thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, till thou thrice deniest that thou knowest me. And he said to them: \n", "35": " When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, did you want anything? \n", "36": " But they said: Nothing. Then said he unto them: But now he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a scrip; and he that hath not, let him sell his coat, and buy a sword. \n", "37": " For I say to you, that this that is written must yet be fulfilled in me: And with the wicked was he reckoned. For the things concerning me have an end. \n", "38": " But they said: Lord, behold here are two swords. And he said to them, It is enough. \n", "39": " And going out, he went, according to his custom, to the mount of Olives. And his disciples also followed him. \n", "40": " And when he was come to the place, he said to them: Pray, lest ye enter into temptation. \n", "41": " And he was withdrawn away from them a stone's cast; and kneeling down, he prayed, \n", "42": " Saying: Father, if thou wilt, remove this chalice from me: but yet not my will, but thine be done. \n", "43": " And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him. And being in an agony, he prayed the longer. \n", "44": " And his sweat became as drops of blood, trickling down upon the ground. \n", "45": " And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow. \n", "46": " And he said to them: Why sleep you? arise, pray, lest you enter into temptation. \n", "47": " As he was yet speaking, behold a multitude; and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to Jesus, for to kiss him. \n", "48": " And Jesus said to him: Judas, dost thou betray the Son of man with a kiss? \n", "49": " And they that were about him, seeing what would follow, said to him: Lord, shall we strike with the sword? \n", "50": " And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. \n", "51": " But Jesus answering, said: Suffer ye thus far. And when he had touched his ear, he healed him. \n", "52": " And Jesus said to the chief priests, and magistrates of the temple, and the ancients, that were come unto him: Are ye come out, as it were against a thief, with swords and clubs? \n", "53": " When I was daily with you in the temple, you did not stretch forth your hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness. \n", "54": " And apprehending him, they led him to the high priest's house. But Peter followed afar off. \n", "55": " And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were sitting about it, Peter was in the midst of them. \n", "56": " Whom when a certain servant maid had seen sitting at the light, and had earnestly beheld him, she said: This man also was with him. \n", "57": " But he denied him, saying: Woman, I know him not. \n", "58": " And after a little while, <u>another</u> seeing him, said: Thou also art one of them. But Peter said: O man, I am not. \n", "59": " And after the space, as it were of one hour, another certain man affirmed, saying: Of a truth, this man was also with him; for he is also a Galilean. \n", "60": " And Peter said: Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, as he was yet speaking, the cock crew. \n", "61": " And the Lord turning looked on Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, as he had said: Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. \n", "62": " And Peter going out, wept bitterly. \n", "63": " And the men that held him, mocked him, and struck him. \n", "64": " And they blindfolded him, and smote his face. And they asked him, saying: Prophesy, who is it that struck thee? \n", "65": " And blaspheming, many other things they said against him. \n", "66": " And as soon as it was day, the ancients of the people, and the chief priests and scribes, came together; and they brought him into their council, saying: If thou be the Christ, tell us. \n", "67": " And he saith to them: If I shall tell you, you will not believe me. \n", "68": " And if I shall also ask you, you will not answer me, nor let me go. \n", "69": " But hereafter the Son of man shall be sitting on the right hand of the power of God. \n", "70": " Then said they all: Art thou then the Son of God? Who said: You say that I am. \n", "71": " And they said: What need we any further testimony? for we ourselves have heard it from his own mouth. \n"}}

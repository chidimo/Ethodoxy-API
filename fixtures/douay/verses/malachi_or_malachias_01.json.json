Was not Esau brother to Jacob, saith the Lord, and <u>I have loved Jacob</u>, \n", "3": " But have hated Esau? and I have made his mountains a wilderness, and given his inheritance to the dragons of the desert. \n", "4": " But if Edom shall say: We are destroyed, but we will return and build up what hath been destroyed: thus saith the Lord of hosts: They shall build up, and I will throw down: and they shall be called the borders of wickedness, and the people with whom the Lord is angry for ever. \n", "5": " And your eyes shall see, and you shall say: The Lord be magnified upon the border of Israel. \n", "6": " The son honoureth the father, and the servant his master: if then I be a father, where is my honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the Lord of hosts. \n", "7": " To you, O priests, that despise my name, and have said: Wherein have we despised thy name? You offer polluted bread upon my altar, and you say: Wherein have we polluted thee? In that you say: The table of the Lord is contemptible. \n", "8": " If you offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if you offer the lame and the sick, is it not evil? offer it to thy prince, if he will be pleased with it, or if he will regard thy face, saith the Lord of hosts. \n", "9": " And now beseech ye the face of God, that he may have mercy on you, (for by your hand hath this been done,) if by any means he will receive your faces, saith the Lord of hosts. \n", "10": " Who is there among you, that will shut the doors, and will kindle the fire on my altar gratis?

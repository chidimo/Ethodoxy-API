{"Mark__07": {"1": " And there assembled together unto him the Pharisees and some of the scribes, coming from Jerusalem. \n", "2": " And when they had seen some of his disciples eat bread with common, that is, with unwashed hands, they found fault. \n", "3": " For the Pharisees, and all the Jews eat not without often washing their hands, holding the tradition of the ancients: \n", "4": " And when they come from the market, unless they be washed, they eat not: and many other things there are that have been delivered to them to observe, the washings of cups and of pots, and of brazen vessels, and of beds. \n", "5": " And the Pharisees and scribes asked him: Why do not thy disciples walk according to the tradition of the ancients, but they eat bread with common hands? \n", "6": " But he answering, said to them: Well did Isaias prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. \n", "7": " And in vain do they worship me, teaching <u>doctrines and precepts of men</u>. \n", "8": " For leaving the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men, the washing of pots and of cups: and many other things you do like to these. \n", "9": " And he said to them: Well do you make void the commandment of God, that you may keep your own tradition. \n", "10": " For Moses said: Honour thy father and thy mother; and He that shall curse father or mother, dying let him die. \n", "11": " But you say: If a man shall say to his father or mother, Corban, (which is a gift,) whatsoever is from me, shall profit thee. \n", "12": " And further you suffer him not to do any thing for his father or mother, \n", "13": " Making void the word of God by your own tradition, which you have given forth. And many other such like things you do. \n", "14": " And calling again the multitude unto him, he said to them: Hear ye me all, and understand. \n", "15": " There is nothing from without a man that entering into him, can defile him. But the things which come from a man, those are they that defile a man. \n", "16": " If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. \n", "17": " And when he was come into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked him the parable. \n", "18": " And he saith to them: So are you also without knowledge? understand you not that every thing from without, entering into a man cannot defile him: \n", "19": " Because it entereth not into his heart, but goeth into the belly, and goeth out into the privy, purging all meats? \n", "20": " But he said that the things which come out from a man, they defile a man. \n", "21": " For from within out of the heart of men proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, \n", "22": " Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness. \n", "23": " All these evil things come from within, and defile a man. \n", "24": " And rising from thence he went into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon: and entering into a house, he would that no man should know it, and he could not be hid. \n", "25": " For a woman as soon as she heard of him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit, came in and fell down at his feet. \n", "26": " For the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophenician born. And she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter. \n", "27": " Who said to her: Suffer first the children to be filled: for it is not good to take the bread of the children, and cast it to the dogs. \n", "28": " But she answered and said to him: Yea, Lord; for the whelps also eat under the table of the crumbs of the children. \n", "29": " And he said to her: For this saying go thy way, the devil is gone out of thy daughter. \n", "30": " And when she was come into her house, she found the girl lying upon the bed, and that the devil was gone out. \n", "31": " And again going out of the coasts of Tyre, he came by Sidon to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis. \n", "32": " And they bring to him one deaf and dumb; and they besought him that he would lay his hand upon him. \n", "33": " And taking him from the multitude apart, he put his fingers into his ears, and spitting, he touched his tongue: \n", "34": " And looking up to heaven, he groaned, and said to him: Ephpheta, which is, Be thou opened. \n", "35": " And immediately his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke right. \n", "36": " And he charged them that they should tell no man. But the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal did they publish it. \n", "37": " And so much the more did they wonder, saying: He hath done all things well; he hath made both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak. \n"}}

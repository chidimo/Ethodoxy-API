{"Mark__15": {"1": " And straightway in the morning, the chief priests holding a consultation with the ancients and the scribes and the whole council, binding Jesus, led him away, and delivered him to Pilate. \n", "2": " And Pilate asked him: Art thou the king of the Jews? But he answering, saith to him: Thou sayest it. \n", "3": " And the chief priests accused him in many things. \n", "4": " And Pilate again asked him, saying: Answerest thou nothing? behold in how many things they accuse thee. \n", "5": " But Jesus still answered nothing; so that Pilate wondered. \n", "6": " Now on the festival day he was wont to release unto them one of the prisoners, whomsoever they demanded. \n", "7": " And there was one called Barabbas, who was put in prison with some seditious men, who in the sedition had committed murder. \n", "8": " And when the multitude was come up, they began to desire that he would do, as he had ever done unto them. \n", "9": " And Pilate answered them, and said: Will you that I release to you the king of the Jews? \n", "10": " For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him up out of envy. \n", "11": " But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas to them. \n", "12": " And Pilate again answering, saith to them: What will you then that I do to the king of the Jews? \n", "13": " But they again cried out: Crucify him. \n", "14": " And Pilate saith to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried out the more: Crucify him. \n", "15": " And so Pilate being willing to satisfy the people, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified. \n", "16": " And the soldiers led him away into the court of the palace, and they called together the whole band: \n", "17": " And they clothe him with purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon him. \n", "18": " And they began to salute him: Hail, king of the Jews. \n", "19": " And they struck his head with a reed: and they did spit on him. And bowing their knees, they adored him. \n", "20": " And after they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own garments on him, and they led him out to crucify him. \n", "21": " And they forced one Simon a Cyrenian who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and of Rufus, to take up his cross. \n", "22": " And they bring him into the place called Golgotha, which being interpreted is, The place of Calvary. \n", "23": " And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh; but he took it not. \n", "24": " And crucifying him, they divided his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take. \n", "25": " And it was <u>the third hour</u>, and they crucified him. \n", "26": " And the inscription of his cause was written over: THE KING OF THE JEWS. \n", "27": " And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. \n", "28": " And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith: And with the wicked he was reputed. \n", "29": " And they that passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying: Vah, thou that destroyest the temple of God, and in three days buildest it up again; \n", "30": " Save thyself, coming down from the cross. \n", "31": " In like manner also the chief priests mocking, said with the scribes one to another: He saved others; himself he cannot save. \n", "32": " Let Christ the king of Israel come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him. \n", "33": " And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole earth until the ninth hour. \n", "34": " And at the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying: Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabacthani? Which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? \n", "35": " And some of the standers by hearing, said: Behold he calleth Elias. \n", "36": " And one running and filling a sponge with vinegar, and putting it upon a reed, gave him to drink, saying: Stay, let us see if Elias come to take him down. \n", "37": " And Jesus having cried out with a loud voice, gave up the ghost. \n", "38": " And the veil of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom. \n", "39": " And the centurion who stood over against him, seeing that crying out in this manner he had given up the ghost, said: Indeed this man was the son of God. \n", "40": " And there were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joseph, and Salome: \n", "41": " Who also when he was in Galilee followed him, and ministered to him, and many other women that came up with him to Jerusalem. \n", "42": " And when evening was now come, (because it was the Parasceve, that is, the day before the sabbath,) \n", "43": " Joseph of Arimathea, a noble counsellor, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. \n", "44": " But Pilate wondered that he should be already dead. And sending for the centurion, he asked him if he were already dead. \n", "45": " And when he had understood it by the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. \n", "46": " And Joseph buying fine linen, and taking him down, wrapped him up in the fine linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewed out of a rock. And he rolled a stone to the door of the sepulchre. \n", "47": " And Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of Joseph, beheld where he was laid. \n"}}

{"Mark__16": {"1": " And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalen, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought sweet spices, that coming, they might anoint Jesus. \n", "2": " And very early in the morning, the first day of the week, they come to the sepulchre, <u>the sun being now risen</u>. \n", "3": " And they said one to another: Who shall roll us back the stone from the door of the sepulchre? \n", "4": " And looking, they saw the stone rolled back. For it was very great. \n", "5": " And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, clothed with a white robe: and they were astonished. \n", "6": " Who saith to them: Be not affrighted; you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified: he is risen, he is not here, behold the place where they laid him. \n", "7": " But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee; there you shall see him, as he told you. \n", "8": " But they going out, fled from the sepulchre. For a trembling and fear had seized them: and they said nothing to any man; for they were afraid. \n", "9": " But he rising early the first day of the week, appeared first to Mary Magdalen, out of whom he had cast seven devils. \n", "10": " She went and told them that had been with him, who were mourning and weeping. \n", "11": " And they hearing that he was alive, and had been seen by her, did not believe. \n", "12": " And after that he appeared in another shape to two of them walking, as they were going into the country. \n", "13": " And they going told it to the rest: neither did they believe them. \n", "14": " At length he appeared to the eleven as they were at table: and he upbraided them with their incredulity and hardness of heart, because they did not believe them who had seen him after he was risen again. \n", "15": " And he said to them: Go ye into the whole world, and preach the gospel to every creature. \n", "16": " He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved: but he that believeth not shall be condemned. \n", "17": " And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name they shall cast out devils: they shall speak with new tongues. \n", "18": " They shall take up serpents; and if they shall drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them: they shall lay their hands upon the sick, and they shall recover. \n", "19": " And the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God. \n", "20": " But they going forth preached everywhere: the Lord working withal, and confirming the word with signs that followed. \n"}}

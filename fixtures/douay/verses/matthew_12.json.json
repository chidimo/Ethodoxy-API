{"Matthew__12": {"1": " At that time Jesus went through the corn on the sabbath: and his disciples being hungry, began to pluck the ears, and to eat. \n", "2": " And the Pharisees seeing them, said to him: Behold thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days. \n", "3": " But he said to them: Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and they that were with him: \n", "4": " How he entered into the house of God, and did eat <u>the loaves of proposition</u>, which it was not lawful for him to eat, nor for them that were with him, but for the priests only? \n", "5": " Or have ye not read in the law, that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple break the sabbath, and are without blame? \n", "6": " But I tell you that there is here a greater than the temple. \n", "7": " And if you knew what this meaneth: I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: you would never have condemned the innocent. \n", "8": " For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath. \n", "9": " And when he had passed from thence, he came into their synagogues. \n", "10": " And behold there was a man who had a withered hand, and they asked him, saying: Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him. \n", "11": " But he said to them: What man shall there be among you, that hath one sheep: and if the same fall into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not take hold on it and lift it up? \n", "12": " How much better is a man than a sheep? Therefore it is lawful to do a good deed on the sabbath days. \n", "13": " Then he saith to the man: Stretch forth thy hand; and he stretched it forth, and it was restored to health even as the other. \n", "14": " And the Pharisees going out made a consultation against him, how they might destroy him. \n", "15": " But Jesus knowing it, retired from thence: and many followed him, and he healed them all. \n", "16": " And he charged them that they should not make him known. \n", "17": " That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaias the prophet, saying: \n", "18": " Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul hath been well pleased. I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew judgment to the Gentiles. \n", "19": " He shall not contend, nor cry out, neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets. \n", "20": " The bruised reed he shall not break: and smoking flax he shall not extinguish: till he send forth judgment unto victory. \n", "21": " And in his name the Gentiles shall hope. \n", "22": " Then was offered to him one possessed with a devil, blind and dumb: and he healed him, so that he spoke and saw. \n", "23": " And all the multitudes were amazed, and said: Is not this the son of David? \n", "24": " But the Pharisees hearing it, said: This man casteth not out the devils but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils. \n", "25": " And Jesus knowing their thoughts, said to them: Every kingdom divided against itself shall be made desolate: and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand. \n", "26": " And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself: how then shall his kingdom stand? \n", "27": " And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges. \n", "28": " But if I by the Spirit of God cast out devils, then is the kingdom of God come upon you. \n", "29": " Or how can any one enter into the house of the strong, and rifle his goods, unless he first bind the strong? and then he will rifle his house. \n", "30": " He that is not with me, is against me: and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth. \n", "31": " Therefore I say to you: Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven men, but <u>the blasphemy of the Spirit</u> shall not be forgiven. \n", "32": " And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but he that shall speak against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, <u>nor in the world to come</u>. \n", "33": " Either make the tree good and its fruit good: or make the tree evil, and its fruit evil. For by the fruit the tree is known. \n", "34": " O generation of vipers, how can you speak good things, whereas you are evil? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. \n", "35": " A good man out of a good treasure bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of an evil treasure bringeth forth evil things. \n", "36": " But I say unto you, that <u>every idle word</u> that men shall speak, they shall render an account for it in the day of judgment. \n", "37": " For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. \n", "38": " Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying: Master we would see <u>a sign</u> from thee. \n", "39": " Who answering said to them: An evil and adulterous generation seeketh a sign: and a sign shall not be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet. \n", "40": " For as Jonas was in the whale's belly <u>three days</u> and three nights: so shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights. \n", "41": " The men of Ninive shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they did penance at the preaching of Jonas. And behold a greater than Jonas here. \n", "42": " The queen of the south shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold a greater than Solomon here. \n", "43": " And when an unclean spirit is gone out of a man he walketh through dry places seeking rest, and findeth none. \n", "44": " Then he saith: I will return into my house from whence I came out. And coming he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. \n", "45": " Then he goeth, and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is made worse than the first. So shall it be also to this wicked generation. \n", "46": " As he was yet speaking to the multitudes, behold his mother and his brethren stood without, seeking to speak to him. \n", "47": " And one said unto him: Behold thy mother and thy brethren stand without, seeking thee. \n", "48": " But he answering him that told him, said: <u>Who is my mother</u>, and who are my brethren? \n", "49": " And stretching forth his hand towards his disciples, he said: Behold my mother and my brethren. \n", "50": " For whosoever shall do the will of my Father, that is in heaven, he is my brother, and sister, and mother. \n"}}

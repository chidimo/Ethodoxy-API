{"Matthew__22": {"1": " And Jesus answering, spoke again in parables to them, saying: \n", "2": " The kingdom of heaven is likened to a king, who made a marriage for his son. \n", "3": " And he sent his servants, to call them that were invited to the marriage; and they would not come. \n", "4": " Again he sent other servants, saying: Tell them that were invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my calves and fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come ye to the marriage. \n", "5": " But they neglected, and went their own ways, one to his farm, and another to his merchandise. \n", "6": " And the rest laid hands on his servants, and having treated them contumeliously, put them to death. \n", "7": " But when the king had heard of it, he was angry, and sending his armies, he destroyed those murderers, and burnt their city. \n", "8": " Then he saith to his servants: The marriage indeed is ready; but they that were invited were not worthy. \n", "9": " Go ye therefore into the highways; and as many as you shall find, call to the marriage. \n", "10": " And his servants going forth into the ways, gathered together all that they found, both bad and good: and the marriage was filled with guests. \n", "11": " And the king went in to see the guests: and he saw there a man who had not on a wedding garment. \n", "12": " And he saith to him: Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? But he was silent. \n", "13": " Then the king said to the waiters: Bind his hands and feet, and cast him into the exterior darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. \n", "14": " For many are called, but few are chosen. \n", "15": " Then the Pharisees going, consulted among themselves how to insnare him in his speech. \n", "16": " And they sent to him their disciples with <u>the Herodians</u>, saying: Master, we know that thou art a true speaker, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou dost not regard the person of men. \n", "17": " Tell us therefore what dost thou think, is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not? \n", "18": " But Jesus knowing their wickedness, said: Why do you tempt me, ye hypocrites? \n", "19": " Shew me the coin of the tribute. And they offered him a penny. \n", "20": " And Jesus saith to them: Whose image and inscription is this? \n", "21": " They say to him: Caesar's. Then he saith to them: Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God, the things that are God's. \n", "22": " And hearing this they wondered, and leaving him, went their ways. \n", "23": " That day there came to him the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection; and asked him, \n", "24": " Saying: Master, Moses said: If a man die having no son, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up issue to his brother. \n", "25": " Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first having married a wife, died; and not having issue, left his wife to his brother. \n", "26": " In like manner the second, and the third, and so on to the seventh. \n", "27": " And last of all the woman died also. \n", "28": " At the resurrection therefore whose wife of the seven shall she be? for they all had her. \n", "29": " And Jesus answering, said to them: You err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. \n", "30": " For in the resurrection they shall neither marry nor be married; but shall be as the angels of God in heaven. \n", "31": " And concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken by God, saying to you: \n", "32": " I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. \n", "33": " And the multitudes hearing it, were in admiration at his doctrine. \n", "34": " But the Pharisees hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees, came together: \n", "35": " And one of them, a doctor of the law, asking him, tempting him: \n", "36": " Master, which is the greatest commandment in the law? \n", "37": " Jesus said to him: Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole mind. \n", "38": " This is the greatest and the first commandment. \n", "39": " And the second is like to this: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. \n", "40": " On these two commandments dependeth the whole law and the prophets. \n", "41": " And the Pharisees being gathered together, Jesus asked them, \n", "42": " Saying: What think you of Christ? whose son is he? They say to him: David's. \n", "43": " He saith to them: How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying: \n", "44": " The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand, until I make thy enemies thy footstool? \n", "45": " If David then call him Lord, how is he his son? \n", "46": " And no man was able to answer him a word; neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more questions. \n"}}

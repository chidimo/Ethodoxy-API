{"Matthew__25": {"1": " Then shall the kingdom of heaven be like to ten virgins, who taking their lamps went out to meet the bridegroom and the bride. \n", "2": " And five of them were foolish, and five wise. \n", "3": " But the five foolish, having taken their lamps, did not take oil with them: \n", "4": " But the wise took oil in their vessels with the lamps. \n", "5": " And the bridegroom tarrying, they all slumbered and slept. \n", "6": " And at midnight there was a cry made: Behold the bridegroom cometh, go ye forth to meet him. \n", "7": " Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps. \n", "8": " And the foolish said to the wise: Give us of your oil, for our lamps are gone out. \n", "9": " The wise answered, saying: Lest perhaps there be not enough for us and for you, go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves. \n", "10": " Now whilst they went to buy, the bridegroom came: and they that were ready, went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut. \n", "11": " But at last come also the other virgins, saying: Lord, Lord, open to us. \n", "12": " But he answering said: Amen I say to you, I know you not. \n", "13": " Watch ye therefore, because you know not the day nor the hour. \n", "14": " For even as a man going into a far country, called his servants, and delivered to them his goods; \n", "15": " And to one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to every one according to his proper ability: and immediately he took his journey. \n", "16": " And he that had received the five talents, went his way, and traded with the same, and gained other five. \n", "17": " And in like manner he that had received the two, gained other two. \n", "18": " But he that had received the one, going his way digged into the earth, and hid his lord's money. \n", "19": " But after a long time the lord of those servants came, and reckoned with them. \n", "20": " And he that had received the five talents coming, brought other five talents, saying: Lord, thou didst deliver to me five talents, behold I have gained other five over and above. \n", "21": " His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant, because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. \n", "22": " And he also that had received the two talents came and said: Lord, thou deliveredst two talents to me: behold I have gained other two. \n", "23": " His lord said to him: Well done, good and faithful servant: because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will place thee over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord. \n", "24": " But he that had received the one talent, came and said: Lord, I know that thou art a hard man; thou reapest where thou hast not sown, and gatherest where thou hast not strewed. \n", "25": " And being afraid I went and hid thy talent in the earth: behold here thou hast that which is thine. \n", "26": " And his lord answering, said to him: Wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sow not, and gather where I have not strewed: \n", "27": " Thou oughtest therefore to have committed my money to the bankers, and at my coming I should have received my own with usury. \n", "28": " Take ye away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him that hath ten talents. \n", "29": " For to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall abound: but from him that hath not, that also which he seemeth to have shall be taken away. \n", "30": " And the unprofitable servant cast ye out into the exterior darkness. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. \n", "31": " And when the Son of man shall come in his majesty, and all the angels with him, then shall he sit upon the seat of his majesty. \n", "32": " And all nations shall be gathered together before him, and he shall separate them one from another, as the shepherd separateth the sheep from the goats: \n", "33": " And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on his left. \n", "34": " Then shall the king say to them that shall be on his right hand: Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. \n", "35": " For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in: \n", "36": " Naked, and you covered me: sick, and you visited me: I was in prison, and you came to me. \n", "37": " Then shall the just answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, and fed thee; thirsty, and gave thee drink? \n", "38": " And when did we see thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and covered thee? \n", "39": " Or when did we see thee sick or in prison, and came to thee? \n", "40": " And the king answering, shall say to them: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it to one of these my least brethren, you did it to me. \n", "41": " Then he shall say to them also that shall be on his left hand: Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels. \n", "42": " For I was hungry, and you gave me not to eat: I was thirsty, and you gave me not to drink. \n", "43": " I was a stranger, and you took me not in: naked, and you covered me not: sick and in prison, and you did not visit me. \n", "44": " Then they also shall answer him, saying: Lord, when did we see thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister to thee? \n", "45": " Then he shall answer them, saying: Amen I say to you, as long as you did it not to one of these least, neither did you do it to me. \n", "46": " And these shall go into everlasting punishment: but the just, into life everlasting. \n"}}

{"Matthew__26": {"1": " And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended all these words, he said to his disciples: \n", "2": " You know that after two days shall be the pasch, and the son of man shall be delivered up to be crucified: \n", "3": " Then were gathered together the chief priests and ancients of the people into the court of the high priest, who was called Caiphas: \n", "4": " And they consulted together, that by subtilty they might apprehend Jesus, and put him to death. \n", "5": " But they said: Not on the festival day, lest perhaps there should be a tumult among the people. \n", "6": " And when Jesus was in Bethania, in the house of Simon the leper, \n", "7": " There came to him a woman having an alabaster box of precious ointment, and poured it on his head as he was at table. \n", "8": " And the disciples seeing it, had indignation, saying: To what purpose is this waste? \n", "9": " For this might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. \n", "10": " And Jesus knowing it, said to them: Why do you trouble this woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me. \n", "11": " For the poor you have always with you: but <u>me you have not always</u>. \n", "12": " For she in pouring this ointment upon my body, hath done it for my burial. \n", "13": " Amen I say to you, wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done, shall be told for a memory of her. \n", "14": " Then went one of the twelve, who was called Judas Iscariot, to the chief priests, \n", "15": " And said to them: What will you give me, and I will deliver him unto you? But they appointed him thirty pieces of silver. \n", "16": " And from thenceforth he sought opportunity to betray him. \n", "17": " And on the first day of the <u>Azymes</u>, the disciples came to Jesus, saying: Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the <u>pasch</u>? \n", "18": " But Jesus said: Go ye into the city to a certain man, and say to him: the master saith, My time is near at hand, with thee I make the pasch with my disciples. \n", "19": " And the disciples did as Jesus appointed to them, and they prepared the pasch. \n", "20": " But when it was evening, he sat down with his twelve disciples. \n", "21": " And whilst they were eating, he said: Amen I say to you, that one of you is about to betray me. \n", "22": " And they being very much troubled, began every one to say: Is it I, Lord? \n", "23": " But he answering, said: He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, he shall betray me. \n", "24": " The Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed: it were better for him, if that man had not been born. \n", "25": " And Judas that betrayed him, answering, said: Is it I, Rabbi? He saith to him: Thou hast said it. \n", "26": " And whilst they were at supper, Jesus took bread, and blessed, and broke: and gave to his disciples, and said: Take ye, and eat. <u>This is my body</u>. \n", "27": " And taking the chalice, he gave thanks, and gave to them, saying: <u>Drink ye all of this</u>. \n", "28": " For this is my <u>blood of the new testament</u>, which shall be shed for many unto remission of sins. \n", "29": " And I say to you, I will not drink from henceforth of this <u>fruit of the vine</u>, until that day when I shall drink it with you new in the kingdom of my Father. \n", "30": " And a hymn being said, they went out unto mount Olivet. \n", "31": " Then Jesus said to them: All you shall be <u>scandalized in me</u> this night. For it is written: I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be dispersed. \n", "32": " But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. \n", "33": " And Peter answering, said to him: Although all shall be scandalized in thee, I will never be scandalized. \n", "34": " Jesus said to him: Amen I say to thee, that in this night before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice. \n", "35": " Peter saith to him: Yea, though I should die with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner said all the disciples. \n", "36": " Then Jesus came with them into a country place which is called Gethsemani; and he said to his disciples: Sit you here, till I go yonder and pray. \n", "37": " And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to grow sorrowful and to be sad. \n", "38": " Then he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death: stay you here, and watch with me. \n", "39": " And going a little further, he fell upon his face, praying, and saying: My Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me. Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt. \n", "40": " And he cometh to his disciples, and findeth them asleep, and he saith to Peter: What? Could you not watch one hour with me? \n", "41": " Watch ye, and pray that ye enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh weak. \n", "42": " Again the second time, he went and prayed, saying: My Father, if this chalice may not pass away, but I must drink it, thy will be done. \n", "43": " And he cometh again and findeth them sleeping: for their eyes were heavy. \n", "44": " And leaving them, he went again: and he prayed the third time, saying the selfsame word. \n", "45": " Then he cometh to his disciples, and saith to them: Sleep ye now and take your rest; behold the hour is at hand, and the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners. \n", "46": " Rise, let us go: behold he is at hand that will betray me. \n", "47": " As he yet spoke, behold Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the ancients of the people. \n", "48": " And he that betrayed him, gave them a sign, saying: Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he, hold him fast. \n", "49": " And forthwith coming to Jesus, he said: Hail, Rabbi. And he kissed him. \n", "50": " And Jesus said to him: Friend, whereto art thou come? Then they came up, and laid hands on Jesus, and held him. \n", "51": " And behold one of them that were with Jesus, stretching forth his hand, drew out his sword: and striking the servant of the high priest, cut off his ear. \n", "52": " Then Jesus saith to him: Put up again thy sword into its place: for all that take the sword shall perish with the sword. \n", "53": " Thinkest thou that I cannot ask my Father, and he will give me presently more than twelve legions of angels? \n", "54": " How then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that so it must be done? \n", "55": " In that same hour Jesus said to the multitudes: You are come out as it were to a robber with swords and clubs to apprehend me. I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you laid not hands on me. \n", "56": " Now all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then the disciples all leaving him, fled. \n", "57": " But they holding Jesus led him to Caiphas the high priest, where the scribes and the ancients were assembled. \n", "58": " And Peter followed him afar off, even to the court of the high priest. And going in, he sat with the servants, that he might see the end. \n", "59": " And the chief priests and the whole council sought false witness against Jesus, that they might put him to death: \n", "60": " And they found not, whereas many false witnesses had come in. And last of all there came two false witnesses: \n", "61": " And they said: This man said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and after three days to rebuild it. \n", "62": " And the high priest rising up, said to him: Answerest thou nothing to the things which these witness against thee? \n", "63": " But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest said to him: I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us if thou be the Christ the Son of God. \n", "64": " Jesus saith to him: Thou hast said it. Nevertheless I say to you, hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God, and coming in the clouds of heaven. \n", "65": " Then the high priests rent his garments, saying: He hath blasphemed; what further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy: \n", "66": " What think you? But they answering, said: He is guilty of death. \n", "67": " Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him: and others struck his face with the palms of their hands, \n", "68": " Saying: Prophesy unto us, O Christ, who is he that struck thee? \n", "69": " But Peter sat without in the court: and there came to him a servant maid, saying: Thou also wast with Jesus the Galilean. \n", "70": " But he denied before them all, saying: I know not what thou sayest. \n", "71": " And as he went out of the gate, another maid saw him, and she saith to them that were there: This man also was with Jesus of Nazareth. \n", "72": " And again he denied with an oath, I know not the man. \n", "73": " And after a little while they came that stood by, and said to Peter: Surely thou also art one of them; for even thy speech doth discover thee. \n", "74": " Then he began to curse and to swear that he knew not the man. And immediately the cock crew. \n", "75": " And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which he had said: Before the cock crow, thou wilt deny me thrice. And going forth, he wept bitterly. \n"}}

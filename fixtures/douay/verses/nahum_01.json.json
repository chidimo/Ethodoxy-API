{"Nahum__01": {"1": " The burden of Ninive. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elcesite. \n", "2": " The Lord is a jealous God, and a revenger: the Lord is a revenger, and hath wrath: the Lord taketh vengeance on his adversaries, and he is angry with his enemies. \n", "3": " The Lord is patient, and great in power, and will not cleanse and acquit the guilty. The Lord's ways are in a tempest, and a whirlwind, and clouds are the dust of his feet. \n", "4": " He rebuketh the sea, and drieth it up: and bringeth all the rivers to be a desert. Basan languisheth and Carmel: and the flower of Libanus fadeth away. \n", "5": " The mountains tremble at him, and the hills are made desolate: and the earth hath quaked at his presence, and the world, and all that dwell therein. \n", "6": " Who can stand before the face of his indignation? and who shall resist in the fierceness of his anger? his indignation is poured out like fire: and the rocks are melted by him. \n", "7": " The Lord is good and giveth strength in the day of trouble: and knoweth them that hope in him. \n", "8": " But with a flood that passeth by, he will make an utter end <u>of the place thereof</u>: and darkness shall pursue his enemies. \n", "9": " What do ye devise against the Lord? he will make an utter end: there shall not rise a double affliction. \n", "10": " For as thorns embrace one another: so while they are feasting and drinking together, they shall be consumed as stubble that is fully dry. \n", "11": " Out of thee <u>shall come forth one</u> that imagineth evil against the Lord, contriving treachery in his mind. \n", "12": " Thus saith the Lord: <u>Though they were perfect</u>: and many of them so, yet thus shall they be cut off, and he shall pass: I have afflicted thee, and I will afflict thee no more. \n", "13": " And now I will break in pieces his rod with which he struck thy back, and I will burst thy bonds asunder. \n", "14": " And the Lord <u>will give a commandment</u> concerning thee, that no more of thy name shall be sown: I will destroy the graven and molten thing out of the house of thy God, I will make it thy grave, for thou art disgraced. \n", "15": " Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, and that preacheth peace: O Juda, keep thy festivals, and pay thy vows: for <u>Belial</u> shall no more pass through thee again, he is utterly cut off. \n"}}

{"Philippians__02": {"1": " If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of charity, if any society of the spirit, if any bowels of commiseration: \n", "2": " Fulfill ye my joy, that you may be of one mind, having the same charity, being of one accord, agreeing in sentiment. \n", "3": " Let nothing be done through contention, neither by vain glory: but in humility, let each esteem others better than themselves: \n", "4": " Each one not considering the things that are his own, but those that are other men's. \n", "5": " For let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: \n", "6": " Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God: \n", "7": " But <u>emptied himself</u>, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and in habit found as a man. \n", "8": " He humbled himself, becoming obedient unto death, even to the death of the cross. \n", "9": " For which cause God also hath exalted him, and hath given him a name which is above all names: \n", "10": " That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth: \n", "11": " And that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is in the glory of God the Father. \n", "12": " Wherefore, my dearly beloved, (as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but much more now in my absence,) <u>with fear</u> and trembling work out your salvation. \n", "13": " For it is God who worketh in you, both to will and to accomplish, according to his good will. \n", "14": " And do ye all things without murmurings and hesitations; \n", "15": " That you may be blameless, and sincere children of God, without reproof, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation; among whom you shine as lights in the world. \n", "16": " Holding forth the word of life to my glory in the day of Christ, because I have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain. \n", "17": " Yea, and if I be made a victim upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and congratulate with you all. \n", "18": " And for the selfsame thing do you also rejoice, and congratulate with me. \n", "19": " And I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy unto you shortly, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know the things concerning you. \n", "20": " For I have no man so of the same mind, who with sincere affection is solicitous for you. \n", "21": " For all seek the things that are their own; not the things that are Jesus Christ's. \n", "22": " Now know ye the proof of him, that as a son with the father, so hath he served with me in the gospel. \n", "23": " Him therefore I hope to send unto you immediately, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me. \n", "24": " And I trust in the Lord, that I myself also shall come to you shortly. \n", "25": " But I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow labourer, and fellow soldier, but your apostle, and he that hath ministered to my wants. \n", "26": " For indeed he longed after you all: and was sad, for that you had heard that he was sick. \n", "27": " For indeed he was sick, nigh unto death; but God had mercy on him; and not only on him, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. \n", "28": " Therefore I sent him the more speedily: that seeing him again, you may rejoice, and I may be without sorrow. \n", "29": " Receive him therefore with all joy in the Lord; and treat with honour such as he is. \n", "30": " Because for the work of Christ he came to the point of death: delivering his life, that he might fulfill that which on your part was wanting towards my service. \n"}}

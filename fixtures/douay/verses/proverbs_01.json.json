Fools despise wisdom and instruction. \n", "8": " My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother: \n", "9": " That grace may be added to thy head, and a chain of gold to thy neck. \n", "10": " My son, if sinners shall entice thee, consent not to them. \n", "11": " If they shall say: Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood, let us hide snares for the innocent without cause: \n", "12": " Let us swallow him up alive like hell, and whole as one that goeth down into the pit. \n", "13": " We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoils. \n", "14": " Cast in thy lot with us, let us all have one purse. \n", "15": " My son, walk not thou with them, restrain thy foot from their paths. \n", "16": " For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. \n", "17": " But a net is spread in vain before the eyes of them that have wings. \n", "18": " And they themselves lie in wait for their own blood, and practise deceits against their own souls. \n", "19": " So the wage of every covetous man destroy the souls of the possessors. \n", "20": " Wisdom preacheth abroad, she uttereth her voice in the streets: \n", "21": " At the head of multitudes she crieth out, in the entrance of the gates of the city she uttereth her words, saying: \n", "22": " O children, how long will you love childishness, and fools covet those things which are hurtful to themselves, and the unwise hate knowledge? \n", "23": " Turn ye at my reproof: behold I will utter my spirit to you, and will shew you my words. \n", "24": " Because I called, and you refused: I stretched out my hand, and there was none that regarded. \n", "25": " You have despised all my counsel, and have neglected my reprehensions. \n", "26": " I also will laugh in your destruction, and will mock when that shall come to you which you feared. \n", "27": " When sudden calamity shall fall on you, and destruction, as a tempest, shall be at hand: when tribulation and distress shall come upon you: \n", "28": " Then shall they call upon me, and I will not hear: they shall rise in the morning and shall not find me: \n", "29": " Because they have hated instruction and received not the fear of the Lord, \n", "30": " Nor consented to my counsel, but despised all my reproof. \n", "31": " Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own way, and shall be filled with their own devices. \n", "32": " The turning away of little ones shall kill them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them. \n", "33": " But he that shall hear me, shall rest without terror, and shall enjoy abundance, without fear of evils. \n"}}

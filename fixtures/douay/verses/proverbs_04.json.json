{"Proverbs__04": {"1": " Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend that you may know prudence. \n", "2": " I will give you a good gift, forsake not my law. \n", "3": " For I also was my father's son, tender and as an only son in the sight of my mother: \n", "4": " And he taught me, and said: Let thy heart receive my words, keep my commandments, and thou shalt live. \n", "5": " Get wisdom, get prudence: forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth. \n", "6": " Forsake her not, and she shall keep thee: love her, and she shall preserve thee. \n", "7": " The beginning of wisdom, get wisdom, and with all thy possession purchase prudence. \n", "8": " Take hold on her, and she shall exalt thee: thou shalt be glorified by her, when thou shalt embrace her. \n", "9": " She shall give to thy head increase of graces, and protect thee with a noble crown. \n", "10": " Hear, O my son, and receive my words, that years of life may be multiplied to thee. \n", "11": " I will shew thee the way of wisdom, I will lead thee by the paths of equity: \n", "12": " Which when thou shalt have entered, thy steps shall not be straitened, and when thou runnest thou shalt not meet a stumblingblock. \n", "13": " Take hold on instruction, leave it not: keep it, because it is thy life. \n", "14": " Be not delighted in the paths of the wicked, neither let the way of evil men please thee. \n", "15": " Flee from it, pass not by it: go aside, and forsake it. \n", "16": " For they sleep not except they have done evil: and their sleep is taken away unless they have made some to fall. \n", "17": " They eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of iniquity. \n", "18": " But the path of the just, as a shining light, goeth forwards and increaseth even to perfect day. \n", "19": " The way of the wicked is darksome: they know not where they fall. \n", "20": " My son, hearken to my words, and incline thy ear to my sayings. \n", "21": " Let them not depart from thy eyes, keep them in the midst of thy heart: \n", "22": " For they are life to those that find them, and health to all flesh. \n", "23": " With all watchfulness keep thy heart, because life issueth out from it. \n", "24": " Remove from thee a froward mouth, and let detracting lips be far from thee. \n", "25": " Let thy eyes look straight on, and let thy eyelids go before thy steps. \n", "26": " Make straight the path for thy feet, and all thy ways shall be established. \n", "27": " Decline not to the right hand, nor to the left: turn away thy foot from evil. For the Lord knoweth the ways that are on the right hand: but those are perverse which are on the left hand. But he will make thy courses straight, he will bring forward thy ways in peace. \n"}}

{"Proverbs__05": {"1": " My son, attend to my wisdom, and incline thy ear to my prudence. \n", "2": " That thou mayst keep thoughts, and thy lips may preserve instruction. Mind not the deceit of a woman. \n", "3": " For the lips of a harlot are like a honeycomb dropping, and her throat is smoother than oil. \n", "4": " But her end is bitter as wormwood, and sharp as a two-edged sword. \n", "5": " Her feet go down into death, and her steps go in as far as hell. \n", "6": " They walk not by the path of life, her steps are wandering, and unaccountable. \n", "7": " Now therefore, my son, hear me, and depart not from the words of my mouth. \n", "8": " Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the doors of her house. \n", "9": " Give not thy honour to strangers, and thy years to the cruel. \n", "10": " Lest strangers be filled with thy strength, and thy labours be in another man's house, \n", "11": " And thou mourn it the last, when thou shalt have spent thy flesh and thy body, and say: \n", "12": " Why have I hated instruction, and my heart consented not to reproof, \n", "13": " And have not heard the voice of them that taught me, and have not inclined my ear to masters? \n", "14": " I have almost been in all evil, in the midst of the church and of the congregation. \n", "15": " Drink water out of thy own cistern, and the streams of thy own well: \n", "16": " Let thy fountains be conveyed abroad, and in the streets divide thy waters. \n", "17": " Keep them to thyself alone, neither let strangers be partakers with thee. \n", "18": " Let thy vein be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of thy youth: \n", "19": " Let her be thy dearest hind, and most agreeable fawn: let her breasts inebriate thee at all times; be thou delighted continually with her love. \n", "20": " Why art thou seduced, my son, by a strange woman, and art cherished in the bosom of another? \n", "21": " The Lord beholdeth the ways of man, and considereth all his steps. \n", "22": " His own iniquities catch the wicked, and he is fast bound with the ropes of his own sins. \n", "23": " He shall die, because he hath not received instruction, and in the multitude of his folly he shall be deceived. \n"}}

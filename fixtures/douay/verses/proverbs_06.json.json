{"Proverbs__06": {"1": " My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, thou hast engaged fast thy hand to a stranger. \n", "2": " Thou art ensnared with the words of thy mouth, and caught with thy own words. \n", "3": " Do therefore, my son, what I say, and deliver thyself: because thou art fallen into the hand of thy neighbour. Run about, make haste, stir up thy friend: \n", "4": " Give not sleep to thy eyes, neither let thy eyelids slumber. \n", "5": " Deliver thyself as a doe from the hand, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. \n", "6": " Go to the ant, O sluggard, and consider her ways, and learn wisdom: \n", "7": " Which, although she hath no guide, nor master, nor captain, \n", "8": " Provideth her meat for herself in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest. \n", "9": " How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou rise out of thy sleep? \n", "10": " Thou wilt sleep a little, thou wilt slumber a little, thou wilt fold thy hands a little to sleep: \n", "11": " And want shall come upon thee, as a traveller, and poverty as a man armed. But if thou be diligent, thy harvest shall come as a fountain, and want shall flee far from thee. \n", "12": " A man that is an apostate, an unprofitable man, walketh with a perverse mouth, \n", "13": " He winketh with the eyes, presseth with the foot, speaketh with the finger. \n", "14": " With a wicked heart he deviseth evil, and at all times he soweth discord. \n", "15": " To such a one his destruction shall presently come, and he shall suddenly be destroyed, and shall no longer have any remedy. \n", "16": " Six things there are, which the Lord hateth, and the seventh his soul detesteth: \n", "17": " Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that shed innocent blood, \n", "18": " A heart that deviseth wicked plots, feet that are swift to run into mischief, \n", "19": " A deceitful witness that uttereth lies, and him that soweth discord among brethren. \n", "20": " My son, keep the commandments of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother. \n", "21": " Bind them in thy heart continually, and put them about thy neck. \n", "22": " When thou walkest, let them go with thee: when thou sleepest, let them keep thee; and when thou awakest, talk with them. \n", "23": " Because the commandment is a lamp, and the law a light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life: \n", "24": " That they may keep thee from the evil woman, and from the flattering tongue of the stranger. \n", "25": " Let not thy heart covet her beauty, be not caught with her winks: \n", "26": " For the price of a harlot is scarce one loaf: but the woman catcheth the precious soul of a man. \n", "27": " Can a man hide fire in his bosom, and his garments not burn? \n", "28": " Or can he walk upon hot coals, and his feet not be burnt? \n", "29": " So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife, shall not be clean when he shall touch her. \n", "30": " <u>The fault is not so great</u> when a man hath stolen: for he stealeth to fill his hungry soul: \n", "31": " And if he be taken he shall restore sevenfold, and shall give up all the substance of his house. \n", "32": " But he that is an adulterer, for the folly of his heart shall destroy his own soul: \n", "33": " He gathereth to himself shame and dishonour, and his reproach shall not be blotted out: \n", "34": " Because the jealousy and rage of the husband will not spare in the day of revenge, \n", "35": " Nor will he yield to any man's prayers, nor will he accept for satisfaction ever so many gifts. \n"}}

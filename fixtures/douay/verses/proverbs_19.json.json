{"Proverbs__19": {"1": " Better is the poor man, that walketh in his simplicity, than a rich man that is perverse in his lips, and unwise. \n", "2": " Where there is no knowledge of the soul, there is no good: and he that is hasty with his feet shall stumble. \n", "3": " The folly of a man supplanteth his steps: and he fretteth in his mind against God. \n", "4": " Riches make many friends: but from the poor man, even they whom he had, depart. \n", "5": " A false witness shall not be unpunished: and he that speaketh lies shall not escape. \n", "6": " Many honour the person of him that is mighty, and are friends of him that giveth gifts. \n", "7": " The brethren of the poor man hate him: moreover also his friends have departed far from him. He that followeth after words only, shall have nothing. \n", "8": " But he that possesseth a mind, loveth his own soul, and he that keepeth prudence shall find good things. \n", "9": " A false witness shall not be unpunished: and he that speaketh lies, shall perish. \n", "10": " Delicacies are not seemly for a fool: nor for a servant to have rule over princes. \n", "11": " The learning of a man is known by patience and his glory is to pass over wrongs. \n", "12": " As the roaring of a lion, so also is the anger of a king: and his cheerfulness as the dew upon the grass. \n", "13": " A foolish son is the grief of his father: and a wrangling wife is like a roof continually dropping through. \n", "14": " House and riches are given by parents: but a prudent wife is properly from the Lord. \n", "15": " Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep, and an idle soul shall suffer hunger. \n", "16": " He that keepeth the commandment, keepeth his own soul: but he that neglecteth his own way, shall die. \n", "17": " He that hath mercy on the poor, lendeth to the Lord: and he will repay him. \n", "18": " Chastise thy son, despair not: but to the killing of him set not thy soul. \n", "19": " He that is impatient, shall suffer damage: and when he shall take away he shall add another thing. \n", "20": " Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayst be wise in thy latter end. \n", "21": " There are many thoughts in the heart of a man: but the will of the Lord shall stand firm. \n", "22": " A needy man is merciful: and better is the poor than the lying man. \n", "23": " The fear of the Lord is unto life: and he shall abide in fulness without being visited with evil. \n", "24": " The slothful hideth his hand under his armpit, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth. \n", "25": " The wicked man being; scourged, the fool shall be wiser: but if thou rebuke a wise man he will understand discipline. \n", "26": " He that afflicteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is infamous and unhappy. \n", "27": " Cease not, O my son, to hear instruction, and be not ignorant of the words of knowledge. \n", "28": " An unjust witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity. \n", "29": " Judgments are prepared for scorners: and striking hammers for the bodies of fools. \n"}}

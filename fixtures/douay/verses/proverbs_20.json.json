{"Proverbs__20": {"1": " Wine is a luxurious thing, and drunkenness riotous: whosoever is delighted therewith shall not be wise. \n", "2": " As the roaring of a lion, so also is the dread of a king: he that provoketh him, sinneth against his own soul. \n", "3": " It is an honour for a man to separate himself from quarrels: but all fools are meddling with reproaches. \n", "4": " Because of the cold the sluggard would not plough: he shall beg therefore in the summer, and it shall not be given him. \n", "5": " Counsel in the heart of a man is like deep water: but a wise man will draw it out. \n", "6": " Many men are called merciful: but who shall find a faithful man? \n", "7": " The just that walketh in his simplicity, shall leave behind him blessed children. \n", "8": " The king, that sitteth on the throne of judgment, scattereth away all evil with his look. \n", "9": " Who can say: My heart is clean, I am pure from sin? \n", "10": " Diverse weights and diverse measures, both are abominable before God. \n", "11": " By his inclinations a child is known, if his works be clean and right. \n", "12": " The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the Lord hath made them both. \n", "13": " Love not sleep, lest poverty oppress thee: open thy eyes, and be filled with bread. \n", "14": " It is nought, it is nought, saith every buyer: and when he is gone away, then he will boast. \n", "15": " There is gold, and a multitude of jewels: but the lips of knowledge are a precious vessel. \n", "16": " Take away the garment of him that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge from him for strangers. \n", "17": " The bread of lying is sweet to a man: but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel. \n", "18": " Designs are strengthened by counsels: and wars are to be managed by governments. \n", "19": " Meddle not with him that revealeth secrets, and walketh deceitfully, and openeth wide his lips. \n", "20": " He that curseth his father, and mother, his lamp shall be put out in the midst of darkness. \n", "21": " The inheritance gotten hastily in the beginning, in the end shall be without a blessing. \n", "22": " Say not: I will return evil: wait for the Lord and he will deliver thee. \n", "23": " Diverse weights are an abomination before the Lord: a deceitful balance is not good. \n", "24": " The steps of man are guided by the Lord: but who is the man that can understand his own way? \n", "25": " It is ruin to a man to devour holy ones, and after vows to retract. \n", "26": " A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth over them the wheel. \n", "27": " The spirit of a man is the lamp of the Lord, which searcheth all the hidden things of the bowels. \n", "28": " Mercy and truth preserve the king, and his throne is strengthened by clemency. \n", "29": " The joy of young men is their strength: and the dignity of old men, their grey hairs. \n", "30": " The blueness of a wound shall wipe away evils: and stripes in the more inward parts of the belly. \n"}}

{"Proverbs__26": {"1": " As snow in summer, and rain in harvest, so glory is not seemly for a fool. \n", "2": " <u>As a bird</u> flying to other places, and a sparrow going here or there: so a curse uttered without cause shall come upon a man. \n", "3": " A whip for a horse, and a snaffle for an ass, and a rod for the back of fools. \n", "4": " <u>Answer not a fool</u> according to his folly, lest thou be made like him. \n", "5": " Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he imagine himself to be wise. \n", "6": " He that sendeth words by a foolish messenger, is lame of feet and drinketh iniquity. \n", "7": " As a lame man hath fair legs in vain: so a parable is unseemly in the mouth of fools. \n", "8": " As he that casteth a stone into the heap of Mercury: so is he that giveth honour to a fool. \n", "9": " As if a thorn should grow in the hand of a drunkard: so is a parable in the mouth of fools. \n", "10": " Judgment determineth causes: and he that putteth a fool to silence, appeaseth anger. \n", "11": " As a dog that returneth to his vomit, so is the fool that repeateth his folly. \n", "12": " Hast thou seen a man wise in his own conceit? there shall be more hope of a fool than of him. \n", "13": " The slothful man saith: There is a lion in the way, and a lioness in the roads. \n", "14": " As the door turneth upon its hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed. \n", "15": " The slothful hideth his hand under his armpit, and it grieveth him to turn it to his mouth. \n", "16": " The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit, than seven men that speak sentences. \n", "17": " As he that taketh a dog by the ears, so is he that passeth by in anger, and meddleth with another man's quarrel. \n", "18": " As he is guilty that shooteth arrows, and lances unto death: \n", "19": " So is the man that hurteth his friend deceitfully: and when he is taken, saith: I did it in jest. \n", "20": " When the wood faileth, the fire shall go out: and when the talebearer is taken away, contentions shall cease. \n", "21": " As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire, so an angry man stirreth up strife. \n", "22": " The words of a talebearer are as it were simple, but they reach to the innermost parts of the belly. \n", "23": " Swelling lips joined with a corrupt heart, are like an earthen vessel adorned with silver dross. \n", "24": " An enemy is known by his lips, when in his heart he entertaineth deceit. \n", "25": " When he shall speak low, trust him not: because there are seven mischiefs in his heart. \n", "26": " He that covereth hatred deceitfully, his malice shall be laid open in the public assembly. \n", "27": " He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: and he that rolleth a stone, it shall return to him. \n", "28": " A deceitful tongue loveth not truth: and a slippery mouth worketh ruin. \n"}}

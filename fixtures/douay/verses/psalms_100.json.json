{"Psalms__100": {"1": " A psalm for David himself. Mercy and judgment I will sing to thee, O Lord: I will sing, \n", "2": " And <u>I will understand</u> in the unspotted way, when thou shalt come to me. I walked in the innocence of my heart, in the midst of my house. \n", "3": " I did not set before my eyes any unjust thing: I hated the workers of iniquities. \n", "4": " The perverse heart did not cleave to me: and the malignant, that turned aside from me, I would not know. \n", "5": " The man that in private detracted his neighbour, him did I persecute. With him that had a proud eye, and an unsatiable heart, I would not eat. \n", "6": " My eyes were upon the faithful of the earth, to sit with me: the man that walked in the perfect way, he served me. \n", "7": " He that worketh pride shall not dwell in the midst of my house: he that speaketh unjust things did not prosper before my eyes. \n", "8": " In the morning I put to death all the wicked of the land: that I might cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the Lord. \n"}}

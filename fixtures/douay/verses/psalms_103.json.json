{"Psalms__103": {"1": " For David himself. Bless the Lord, O my soul: O Lord my God, thou art exceedingly great. Thou hast put on praise and beauty: \n", "2": " And art clothed with light as with a garment. Who stretchest out the heaven like a pavilion: \n", "3": " Who coverest the higher rooms thereof with water. Who makest the clouds thy chariot: who walkest upon the wings of the winds. \n", "4": " Who makest thy angels spirits: and thy ministers a burning fire. \n", "5": " Who hast founded the earth upon its own bases: it shall not be moved for ever and ever. \n", "6": " The deep like a garment is its clothing: above the mountains shall the waters stand. \n", "7": " At thy rebuke they shall flee: at the voice of thy thunder they shall fear. \n", "8": " The mountains ascend, and the plains descend into the place which thou hast founded for them. \n", "9": " Thou hast set a bound which they shall not pass over; neither shall they return to cover the earth. \n", "10": " Thou sendest forth springs in the vales: between the midst of the hills the waters shall pass. \n", "11": " All the beasts of the field shall drink: the wild asses shall expect in their thirst. \n", "12": " Over them the birds of the air shall dwell: from the midst of the rocks they shall give forth their voices. \n", "13": " Thou waterest the hills from thy upper rooms: the earth shall be filled with the fruit of thy works: \n", "14": " Bringing forth grass for cattle, and herb for the service of men. That thou mayst bring bread out of the earth: \n", "15": " And that wine may cheer the heart of man. That he may make the face cheerful with oil: and that bread may strengthen man's heart. \n", "16": " The trees of the field shall be filled, and the cedars of Libanus which he hath planted: \n", "17": " There the sparrows shall make their nests. The highest of them is the house of the heron. \n", "18": " The high hills are a refuge for the harts, the rock for the irchins. \n", "19": " He hath made the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down. \n", "20": " Thou hast appointed darkness, and it is night: in it shall all the beasts of the woods go about: \n", "21": " The young lions roaring after their prey, and seeking their meat from God. \n", "22": " The sun ariseth, and they are gathered together: and they shall lie down in their dens. \n", "23": " Man shall go forth to his work, and to his labour until the evening. \n", "24": " How great are thy works, O Lord? thou hast made all things in wisdom: the earth is filled with thy riches. \n", "25": " So is this great sea, which stretcheth wide its arms: there are creeping things without number: Creatures little and great. \n", "26": " There the ships shall go. This sea dragon which thou hast formed to play therein. \n", "27": " All expect of thee that thou give them food in season. \n", "28": " What thou givest to them they shall gather up: when thou openest thy hand, they shall all be filled with good. \n", "29": " But if thou turnest away thy face, they shall be troubled: thou shalt take away their breath, and they shall fail, and shall return to their dust. \n", "30": " Thou shalt send forth thy spirit, and they shall be created: and thou shalt renew the face of the earth. \n", "31": " May the glory of the Lord endure for ever: the Lord shall rejoice in his works. \n", "32": " He looketh upon the earth, and maketh it tremble: he toucheth the mountains, and they smoke. \n", "33": " I will sing to the Lord as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being. \n", "34": " Let my speech be acceptable to him: but I will take delight in the Lord. \n", "35": " Let sinners be consumed out of the earth, and the unjust, so that they be no more: O my soul, bless thou the Lord. \n"}}

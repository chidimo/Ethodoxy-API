{"Psalms__108": {"1": " Unto the end, a psalm for David. \n", "2": " O God, be not thou silent in my praise: for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful man is opened against me. \n", "3": " They have spoken against me with deceitful tongues; and they have compassed me about with words of hatred; and have fought against me without cause. \n", "4": " Instead of making me a return of love, they detracted me: but I gave myself to prayer. \n", "5": " And they repaid me evil for good: and hatred for my love. \n", "6": " <u>Set thou the sinner over him</u>: and may the devil stand at his right hand. \n", "7": " When he is judged, may he go out condemned; and may his prayer be turned to sin. \n", "8": " May his days be few: and his bishopric let another take. \n", "9": " May his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow. \n", "10": " Let his children be carried about vagabonds, and beg; and let them be cast out of their dwellings. \n", "11": " May the usurer search all his substance: and let strangers plunder his labours. \n", "12": " May there be none to help him: nor none to pity his fatherless offspring. \n", "13": " May his posterity be cut off; in one generation may his name be blotted out. \n", "14": " May the iniquity of his fathers be remembered in the sight of the Lord: and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out. \n", "15": " May they be before the Lord continually, and let the memory of them perish from the earth: \n", "16": " because he remembered not to shew mercy, \n", "17": " But persecuted the poor man and the beggar; and the broken in heart, to put him to death. \n", "18": " And he loved cursing, and it shall come unto him: and he would not have blessing, and it shall be far from him. And he put on cursing, like a garment: and it went in like water into his entrails, and like oil in his bones. \n", "19": " May it be unto him like a garment which covereth him; and like a girdle with which he is girded continually. \n", "20": " This is the work of them who detract me before the Lord; and who speak evils against my soul. \n", "21": " But thou, O Lord, do with me for thy name's sake: because thy mercy is sweet. Do thou deliver me, \n", "22": " for I am poor and needy, and my heart is troubled within me. \n", "23": " I am taken away like the shadow when it declineth: and I am shaken off as locusts. \n", "24": " My knees are weakened through fasting: and my flesh is changed <u>for oil</u>. \n", "25": " And I am become a reproach to them: they saw me and they shaked their heads, \n", "26": " Help me, O Lord my God; save me according to thy mercy. \n", "27": " And let them know that this is thy hand: and that thou, O Lord, hast done it. \n", "28": " They will curse and thou will bless: let them that rise up against me be confounded: but thy servant shall rejoice. \n", "29": " Let them that detract me be clothed with shame: and let them be covered with their confusion as with a double cloak. \n", "30": " I will give great thanks to the Lord with my mouth: and in the midst of many I will praise him. \n", "31": " Because he hath stood at the right hand of the poor, to save my soul from persecutors. \n"}}

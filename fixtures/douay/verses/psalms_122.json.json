{"Psalms__122": {"1": " To thee have I lifted up my eyes, who dwellest in heaven. \n", "2": " Behold as the eyes of the servants are on the hands of their masters, As the eyes of the handmaid are on the hands of her mistress: so are our eyes unto the Lord our God, until he have mercy on us. \n", "3": " Have mercy on us, O Lord, have mercy on us: for we are greatly filled with contempt. \n", "4": " For our soul is greatly filled: we are a reproach to the rich, and contempt to the proud. \n"}}

{"Psalms__126": {"1": " Unless the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it. Unless the Lord keep the city, he watcheth in vain that keepeth it. \n", "2": " <u>It is vain for you to rise before light</u>, rise ye after you have sitten, you that eat the bread of sorrow. When he shall give sleep to his beloved, \n", "3": " Behold the inheritance of the Lord are children: the reward, the fruit of the womb. \n", "4": " As arrows in the hand of the mighty, so the children of them that have been shaken. \n", "5": " Blessed is the man that hath filled the desire with them; he shall not be confounded when he shall speak to his enemies in the gate. \n"}}

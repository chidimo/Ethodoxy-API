{"Psalms__130": {"1": " Lord, my heart is not exalted: nor are my eyes lofty. Neither have I walked in great matters, nor in wonderful things above me. \n", "2": " If I was not humbly minded, but exalted my soul: As a child that is weaned is towards his mother, so reward in my soul. \n", "3": " Let Israel hope in the Lord, from henceforth now and for ever. \n"}}

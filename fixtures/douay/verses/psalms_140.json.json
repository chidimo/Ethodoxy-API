{"Psalms__140": {"1": " I have cried to the, O Lord, hear me: hearken to my voice, when I cry to thee. \n", "2": " Let my prayer be directed as incense in thy sight; the lifting up of my hands, as evening sacrifice. \n", "3": " Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth: and a door round about my lips. \n", "4": " Incline not my heart to evil words; to make excuses in sins. With men that work iniquity: and I will not communicate with the choicest of them. \n", "5": " The just shall correct me in mercy, and shall reprove me: but <u>let not the oil of the sinner</u> fatten my head. <u>For my prayer</u> also shall still be against the things with which they are well pleased: \n", "6": " <u>Their judges</u> falling upon the rock have been swallowed up. They shall hear my words, for they have prevailed: \n", "7": " As when the thickness of the earth is broken up upon the ground: Our bones are scattered by the side of hell. \n", "8": " But o to thee, O Lord, Lord, are my eyes: in thee have I put my trust, take not away my soul. \n", "9": " Keep me from the snare, which they have laid for me, and from the stumblingblocks of them that work iniquity. \n", "10": " The wicked shall fall in his net: <u>I am alone</u> until I pass. \n"}}

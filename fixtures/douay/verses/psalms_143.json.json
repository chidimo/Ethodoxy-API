{"Psalms__143": {"1": " Blessed be the Lord my God, who teacheth my hands to fight, and my fingers to war. \n", "2": " My mercy, and my refuge: my support, and my deliverer: My protector, and I have hoped in him: who subdueth my people under me. \n", "3": " Lord, what is man, that thou art made known to him? or the son of man, that thou makest account of him? \n", "4": " Man is like to vanity: his days pass away like a shadow. \n", "5": " Lord, bow down thy heavens and descend: touch the mountains and they shall smoke. \n", "6": " Send forth lightning, and thou shalt scatter them: shoot out thy arrows, and thou shalt trouble them. \n", "7": " Put forth thy hand from on high, take me out, and deliver me from many waters: from the hand of strange children: \n", "8": " Whose mouth hath spoken vanity: and their right hand is the right hand of iniquity. \n", "9": " To thee, O God, I will sing a new canticle: on the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings I will sing praises to thee. \n", "10": " Who givest salvation to kings: who hast redeemed thy servant David from the malicious sword: \n", "11": " Deliver me, And rescue me out of the hand of strange children; whose mouth hath spoken vanity: and their right hand is the right hand of iniquity: \n", "12": " Whose sons are as new plants in their youth: Their daughters decked out, adorned round about after the similitude of a temple: \n", "13": " Their storehouses full, flowing out of this into that. Their sheep fruitful in young, abounding in their goings forth: \n", "14": " Their oxen fat. There is no breach of wall, nor passage, nor crying out in their streets. \n", "15": " They have called the people happy, that hath these things: but happy is that people whose God is the Lord. \n"}}

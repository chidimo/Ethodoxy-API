{"Psalms__16": {"1": " The prayer of David. Hear, O Lord, my justice: attend to my supplication. Give ear unto my prayer, which proceedeth not from deceitful lips. \n", "2": " Let my judgment come forth from thy countenance: let thy eyes behold the things that are equitable. \n", "3": " Thou hast proved my heart, and visited it by night, thou hast tried me by fire: and iniquity hath not been found in me. \n", "4": " That my mouth may not speak the works of men: for the sake of the words of thy lips, I have kept hard ways. \n", "5": " Perfect thou my goings in thy paths: that my footsteps be not moved. \n", "6": " I have cried to thee, for thou, O God, hast heard me: O incline thy ear unto me, and hear my words. \n", "7": " shew forth thy wonderful mercies; thou who savest them that trust in thee. \n", "8": " From them that resist thy right hand keep me, as the apple of thy eye. Protect me under the shadow of thy wings. \n", "9": " From the face of the wicked who have afflicted me. My enemies have surrounded my soul: \n", "10": " They have shut up <u>their fat</u>: their mouth hath spoken proudly. \n", "11": " They have cast me forth and now they have surrounded me: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth. \n", "12": " They have taken me, as a lion prepared for the prey; and as a young lion dwelling in secret places. \n", "13": " Arise, O Lord, disappoint him and supplant him; deliver my soul from the wicked one: thy sword \n", "14": " From the enemies of thy hand. O Lord, <u>divide them from the few</u> of the earth in their life: their belly is filled from <u>thy hidden stores</u>. They are full of children: and they have left to their little ones the rest of their substance. \n", "15": " But as for me, I will appear before thy sight in justice: I shall be satisfied when thy glory shall appear. \n"}}

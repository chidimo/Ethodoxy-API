{"Psalms__18": {"1": " Unto the end. A psalm for David. \n", "2": " The heavens shew forth the glory of God, and the firmament declareth the work of his hands. \n", "3": " Day to day uttereth speech, and night to night sheweth knowledge. \n", "4": " There are no speeches nor languages, where their voices are not heard. \n", "5": " Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth: and their words unto the ends of the world. \n", "6": " He hath set his tabernacle in the sun: and he, as a bridegroom coming out of his bride chamber, Hath rejoiced as a giant to run the way: \n", "7": " His going out is from the end of heaven, And his circuit even to the end thereof: and there is no one that can hide himself from his heat. \n", "8": " The law of the Lord is unspotted, converting souls: the testimony of the Lord is faithful, giving wisdom to little ones. \n", "9": " The justices of the Lord are right, rejoicing hearts: the commandment of the Lord is lightsome, enlightening the eyes. \n", "10": " The fear of the Lord is holy, enduring for ever and ever: the judgments of the Lord are true, justified in themselves. \n", "11": " More to be desired than gold and many precious stones: and sweeter than honey and the honeycomb. \n", "12": " For thy servant keepeth them, and in keeping them there is a great reward. \n", "13": " Who can understand sins? from my secret ones cleanse me, O Lord: \n", "14": " And from those of others spare thy servant. If they shall have no dominion over me, then shall I be without spot: and I shall be cleansed from the greatest sin. \n", "15": " And the words of my mouth shall be such as may please: and the meditation of my heart always in thy sight. O Lord, my helper, and my redeemer. \n"}}

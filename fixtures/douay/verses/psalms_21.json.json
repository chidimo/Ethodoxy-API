{"Psalms__21": {"1": " Unto the end, for the morning protection, a psalm for David. \n", "2": " O God my God, look upon me: why hast thou forsaken me? Far from my salvation are <u>the words of my sins</u>. \n", "3": " O my God, I shall cry by day, and thou wilt not hear: and by night, and it shall not be reputed as folly in me. \n", "4": " But thou dwellest in the holy place, the praise of Israel. \n", "5": " In thee have our fathers hoped: they have hoped, and thou hast delivered them. \n", "6": " They cried to thee, and they were saved: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded. \n", "7": " But I am a worm, and no man: the reproach of men, and the outcast of the people. \n", "8": " All they that saw me have laughed me to scorn: they have spoken with the lips, and wagged the head. \n", "9": " He hoped in the Lord, let him deliver him: let him save him, seeing he delighteth in him. \n", "10": " For thou art he that hast drawn me out of the womb: my hope from the breasts of my mother. \n", "11": " I was cast upon thee from the womb. From my mother's womb thou art my God, \n", "12": " Depart not from me. For tribulation is very near: for there is none to help me. \n", "13": " Many calves have surrounded me: fat bulls have besieged me. \n", "14": " They have opened their mouths against me, as a lion ravening and roaring. \n", "15": " I am poured out like water; and all my bones are scattered. My heart is become like wax melting in the midst of my bowels. \n", "16": " My strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue hath cleaved to my jaws: and thou hast brought me down into the dust of death. \n", "17": " For many dogs have encompassed me: the council of the malignant hath besieged me. They have dug my hands and feet. \n", "18": " They have numbered all my bones. And they have looked and stared upon me. \n", "19": " They parted my garments amongst them; and upon my vesture they cast lots. \n", "20": " But thou, O Lord, remove not thy help to a distance from me; look towards my defence. \n", "21": " Deliver, O God, my soul from the sword: my only one from the hand of the dog. \n", "22": " Save me from the lion's mouth; and my lowness from the horns of the unicorns. \n", "23": " I will declare thy name to my brethren: in the midst of the church will I praise thee. \n", "24": " Ye that fear the Lord, praise him: all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him. \n", "25": " Let all the seed of Israel fear him: because he hath not slighted nor despised the supplication of the poor man. Neither hath he turned away his face from me: and when I cried to him he heard me. \n", "26": " With thee is my praise in a great church: I will pay my vows in the sight of them that fear him. \n", "27": " The poor shall eat and shall be filled: and they shall praise the Lord that seek him: their hearts shall live for ever and ever. \n", "28": " All the ends of the earth shall remember, and shall be converted to the Lord: And all the kindreds of the Gentiles shall adore in his sight. \n", "29": " For the kingdom is the Lord's; and he shall have dominion over the nations. \n", "30": " All the fat ones of the earth have eaten and have adored: all they that go down to the earth shall fall before him. \n", "31": " And to him my soul shall live: and my seed shall serve him. \n", "32": " There shall be declared to the Lord a generation to come: and the heavens shall shew forth his justice to a people that shall be born, which the Lord hath made. \n"}}

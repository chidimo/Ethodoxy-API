He hath led me on the paths of justice, for his own name's sake. \n", "4": " For though I should walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I will fear no evils, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they have comforted me. \n", "5": " Thou hast prepared a table before me against them that afflict me. Thou hast anointed my head with oil; and my chalice which inebriateth me, how goodly is it! \n", "6": " And thy mercy will follow me all the days of my life. And that I may dwell in the house of the Lord unto length of days. \n"}}

{"Psalms__30": {"1": " Unto the end, a psalm for David, in an ecstasy. \n", "2": " In thee, O Lord, have I hoped, let me never be confounded: deliver me in thy justice. \n", "3": " Bow down thy ear to me: make haste to deliver me. Be thou unto me a God, a protector, and a house of refuge, to save me. \n", "4": " For thou art my strength and my refuge; and for thy name's sake thou wilt lead me, and nourish me. \n", "5": " Thou wilt bring me out of this snare, which they have hidden for me: for thou art my protector. \n", "6": " Into thy hands I commend my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O Lord, the God of truth. \n", "7": " Thou hast hated them that regard vanities, to no purpose. But I have hoped in the Lord: \n", "8": " I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy. For thou hast regarded my humility, thou hast saved my soul out of distresses. \n", "9": " And thou hast not shut me up in the hands of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a spacious place. \n", "10": " Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am afflicted: my eye is troubled with wrath, my soul, and my belly: \n", "11": " For my life is wasted with grief: and my years in sighs. My strength is weakened through poverty and my bones are disturbed. \n", "12": " I am become a reproach among all my enemies, and very much to my neighbours; and a fear to my acquaintance. They that saw me without fled from me. \n", "13": " I am forgotten as one dead from the heart. I am become as a vessel that is destroyed. \n", "14": " For I have heard the blame of many that dwell round about. While they assembled together against me, they consulted to take away my life. \n", "15": " But I have put my trust in thee, O Lord: I said: Thou art my God. \n", "16": " My lots are in thy hands. Deliver me out of the hands of my enemies; and from them that persecute me. \n", "17": " Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; save me in thy mercy. \n", "18": " Let me not be confounded, O Lord, for I have called upon thee. Let the wicked be ashamed, and be brought down to hell. \n", "19": " Let deceitful lips be made dumb. Which speak iniquity against the just, with pride and abuse. \n", "20": " O how great is the multitude of thy sweetness, O Lord, which thou hast hidden for them that fear thee! Which thou hast wrought for them that hope in thee, in the sight of the sons of men. \n", "21": " Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy face, from the disturbance of men. Thou shalt protect them in thy tabernacle from the contradiction of tongues. \n", "22": " Blessed be the Lord, for he hath shewn his wonderful mercy to me in a fortified city. \n", "23": " But I said in the excess of my mind: I am cast away from before thy eyes. Therefore thou hast heard the voice of my prayer, when I cried to thee. \n", "24": " O love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord will require truth, and will repay them abundantly that act proudly. \n", "25": " Do ye manfully, and let your heart be strengthened, all ye that hope in the Lord. \n"}}

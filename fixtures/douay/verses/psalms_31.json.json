{"Psalms__31": {"1": " To David himself, understanding. Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. \n", "2": " Blessed is the man to whom the Lord hath not imputed sin, and in whose spirit there is no guile. \n", "3": " <u>Because I was silent</u> my bones grew old; whilst I cried out all the day long. \n", "4": " For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: <u>I am turned</u> in my anguish, whilst the thorn is fastened. \n", "5": " I have acknowledged my sin to thee, and my injustice I have not concealed. I said I will confess against myself my injustice to the Lord: and thou hast forgiven the wickedness of my sin. \n", "6": " For this shall every one that is holy pray to thee in a seasonable time. And yet in a flood of many waters, they shall not come nigh unto him. \n", "7": " Thou art my refuge from the trouble which hath encompassed me: my joy, deliver me from them that surround me. \n", "8": " I will give thee understanding, and I will instruct thee in this way, in which thou shalt go: I will fix my eyes upon thee. \n", "9": " Do not become like the horse and the mule, who have no understanding. With bit and bridle bind fast their jaws, who come not near unto thee. \n", "10": " Many are the scourges of the sinner, but mercy shall encompass him that hopeth in the Lord. \n", "11": " Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye just, and glory, all ye right of heart. \n"}}

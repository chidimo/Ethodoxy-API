{"Psalms__34": {"1": " For David himself. Judge thou, O Lord, them that wrong me: overthrow them that fight against me. \n", "2": " Take hold of arms and shield: and rise up to help me. \n", "3": " Bring out the sword, and shut up the way against them that persecute me: say to my soul: I am thy salvation. \n", "4": " Let them be confounded and ashamed that seek after my soul. Let them be turned back and be confounded that devise against me. \n", "5": " Let them become as dust before the wind: and let the angel of the Lord straiten them. \n", "6": " Let their way become dark and slippery; and let the angel of the Lord pursue them. \n", "7": " For without cause they have hidden their net for me unto destruction: without cause they have upbraided my soul. \n", "8": " Let the snare which he knoweth not come upon him: and let the net which he hath hidden catch him: and let the net which he hath hidden catch him: and into that very snare let them fall. \n", "9": " But my soul shall rejoice in the Lord; and shall be delighted in his salvation. \n", "10": " All my bones shall say: Lord, who is like to thee? Who deliverest the poor from the hand of them that are stronger than he; the needy and the poor from them that strip him. \n", "11": " Unjust witnesses rising up have asked me things I knew not. \n", "12": " They repaid me evil for good: to the depriving me of my soul. \n", "13": " But as for me, when they were troublesome to me, I was clothed with haircloth. I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer shall be turned into my bosom. \n", "14": " As a neighbour and as an own brother, so did I please: as one mourning and sorrowful so was I humbled. \n", "15": " But they rejoiced against me, and came together: scourges were gathered together upon me, and I knew not. \n", "16": " They were separated, and repented not: they tempted me, they scoffed at me with scorn: they gnashed upon me with their teeth. \n", "17": " Lord, when wilt thou look upon me? rescue thou my soul from their malice: my only one from the lions. \n", "18": " I will give thanks to thee in a great church; I will praise thee in a strong people. \n", "19": " Let not them that are my enemies wrongfully rejoice over me: who have hated me without cause, and wink with the eyes. \n", "20": " For they spoke indeed peaceably to me; and speaking in the anger of the earth they devised guile. \n", "21": " And they opened their mouth wide against me; they said: Well done, well done, our eyes have seen it. \n", "22": " Thou hast seen, O Lord, be not thou silent: O Lord, depart not from me. \n", "23": " Arise, and be attentive to my judgment: to my cause, my God, and my Lord. \n", "24": " Judge me, O Lord my God according to thy justice, and let them not rejoice over me. \n", "25": " Let them not say in their hearts: It is well, it is well, to our mind: neither let them say: We have swallowed him up. \n", "26": " Let them blush: and be ashamed together, who rejoice at my evils. Let them be clothed with confusion and shame, who speak great things against me. \n", "27": " Let them rejoice and be glad, who are well pleased with my justice, and let them say always: The Lord be magnified, who delights in the peace of his servant. \n", "28": " And my tongue shall meditate thy justice, thy praise all the day long. \n"}}

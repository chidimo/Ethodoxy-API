{"Psalms__36": {"1": " A psalm for David himself. Be not emulous of evildoers; nor envy them that work iniquity. \n", "2": " For they shall shortly wither away as grass, and as the green herbs shall quickly fall. \n", "3": " Trust in the Lord, and do good, and dwell in the land, and thou shalt be fed with its riches. \n", "4": " Delight in the Lord, and he will give thee the requests of thy heart. \n", "5": " Commit thy way to the Lord, and trust in him, and he will do it. \n", "6": " And he will bring forth thy justice as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday. \n", "7": " Be subject to the Lord and pray to him Envy not the man who prospereth in his way; the man who doth unjust things. \n", "8": " Cease from anger, and leave rage; have no emulation to do evil. \n", "9": " For the evildoers shall be cut off: but they that wait upon the Lord shall inherit the land. \n", "10": " For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: and thou shalt seek his place, and shalt not find it. \n", "11": " But the meek shall inherit the land, and shall delight in abundance of peace. \n", "12": " The sinner shall watch the just man: and shall gnash upon him with his teeth. \n", "13": " But the Lord shall laugh at him: for he foreseeth that his day shall come. \n", "14": " The wicked have drawn out the sword: they have bent their bow. To cast down the poor and needy, to kill the upright of heart. \n", "15": " Let their sword enter into their own hearts, and let their bow be broken. \n", "16": " Better is a little to the just, than the great riches of the wicked. \n", "17": " For the arms of the wicked shall be broken in pieces; but the Lord strengtheneth the just. \n", "18": " The Lord knoweth the days of undefiled; and their inheritance shall be for ever. \n", "19": " They shall not be confounded in the evil time; and in the days of famine they shall be filled: \n", "20": " Because the wicked shall perish. And the enemies of the Lord, presently after they shall be honoured and exalted, shall come to nothing and vanish like smoke. \n", "21": " The sinner shall borrow, and not pay again; but the just sheweth mercy and shall give. \n", "22": " For such as bless him shall inherit the land: but such as curse him shall perish. \n", "23": " With the Lord shall the steps of a man be directed, and he shall like well his way. \n", "24": " When he shall fall he shall not be bruised, for the Lord putteth his hand under him. \n", "25": " I have been young, and now am old; and I have not seen the just forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread. \n", "26": " He sheweth mercy, and lendeth all the day long; and his seed shall be in blessing. \n", "27": " Decline from evil and do good, and dwell for ever and ever. \n", "28": " For the Lord loveth judgment, and will not forsake his saints: they shall be preserved for ever. The unjust shall be punished, and the seed of the wicked shall perish. \n", "29": " But the just shall inherit the land, and shall dwell therein for evermore. \n", "30": " The mouth of the just shall meditate wisdom: and his tongue shall speak judgment. \n", "31": " The law of his God is in his heart, and his steps shall not be supplanted. \n", "32": " The wicked watcheth the just man, and seeketh to put him to death, \n", "33": " But the Lord will not leave in his hands; nor condemn him when he shall be judged. \n", "34": " Expect the Lord and keep his way: and he will exalt thee to inherit the land: when the sinners shall perish thou shalt see. \n", "35": " I have seen the wicked highly exalted, and lifted up like the cedars of Libanus. \n", "36": " And I passed by, and lo, he was not: and I sought him and his place was not found. \n", "37": " Keep innocence, and behold justice: for there are remnants for the peaceable man. \n", "38": " But the unjust shall be destroyed together: the remnants of the wicked shall perish. \n", "39": " But the salvation of the just is from the Lord, and he is their protector in the time of trouble. \n", "40": " And the Lord will help them and deliver them: and he will rescue them from the wicked, and save them, because they have hoped in him. \n"}}

He went out and spoke to the same purpose. \n", "8": " All my enemies whispered together against me: they devised evils to me. \n", "9": " They determined against me an unjust word: shall he that sleepeth rise again no more? \n", "10": " For even the man of peace, in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, hath greatly supplanted me. \n", "11": " But thou, O Lord, have mercy on me, and raise me up again: and I will requite them. \n", "12": " By this I know, that thou hast had a good will for me: because my enemy shall not rejoice over me. \n", "13": " But thou hast upheld me by reason of my innocence: and hast established me in thy sight for ever. \n", "14": " Blessed be the Lord the God of Israel from eternity to eternity. So be it. So be it. \n"}}

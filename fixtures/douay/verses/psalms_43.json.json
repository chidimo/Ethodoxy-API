{"Psalms__43": {"1": " Unto the end, for the sons of Core, to give understanding. \n", "2": " We have heard, O God, with our ears: our fathers have declared to us, The work, thou hast wrought in their days, and in the days of old. \n", "3": " Thy hand destroyed the Gentiles, and thou plantedst them: thou didst afflict the people and cast them out. \n", "4": " For they got not the possession of the land by their own sword: neither did their own arm save them. But thy right hand and thy arm, and the light of thy countenance: because thou wast pleased with them. \n", "5": " Thou art thyself my king and my God, who commandest the saving of Jacob. \n", "6": " Through thee we will push down our enemies with the horn: and through thy name we will despise them that rise up against us. \n", "7": " For I will not trust in my bow: neither shall my sword save me. \n", "8": " But thou hast saved us from them that afflict us: and hast put them to shame that hate us. \n", "9": " In God shall we glory all the day long: and in thy name we will give praise for ever. \n", "10": " But now thou hast cast us off, and put us to shame: and thou, O God, wilt not go out with our armies. \n", "11": " Thou hast made us turn our back to our enemies: and they that hated us plundered for themselves. \n", "12": " Thou hast given us up like sheep to be eaten: thou hast scattered us among the nations. \n", "13": " Thou hast sold thy people for no price: and there was no reckoning in the exchange of them. \n", "14": " Thou hast made us a reproach to our neighbours, a scoff and derision to them that are round about us. \n", "15": " Thou hast made us a byword among the Gentiles: a shaking of the head among the people. \n", "16": " All the day long my shame is before me: and the confusion of my face hath covered me, \n", "17": " At the voice of him that reproacheth and detracteth me: at the face of the enemy and persecutor. \n", "18": " All these things have come upon us, yet we have not forgotten thee: and we have not done wickedly in they covenant. \n", "19": " And our heart hath not turned back: neither hast thou turned aside our steps from thy way. \n", "20": " For thou hast humbled us in the place of affliction: and the shadow of death hath covered us. \n", "21": " If we have forgotten the name of our God, and if we have spread forth our hands to a strange god: \n", "22": " Shall not God search out these things: for he knoweth the secrets of the heart. Because for thy sake we are killed all the day long: we are counted as sheep for the slaughter. \n", "23": " Arise, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, and cast us not off to the end. \n", "24": " Why turnest thou face away? and forgettest our want and our trouble? \n", "25": " For our soul is humbled down to the dust: our belly cleaveth to the earth. \n", "26": " Arise, O Lord, help us and redeem us for thy name's sake. \n"}}

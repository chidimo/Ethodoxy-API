{"Psalms__52": {"1": " Unto the end, for <u>Maeleth</u>, understandings to David. The fool said in his heart: There is no God. \n", "2": " They are corrupted, and become abominable in iniquities: there is none that doth good. \n", "3": " God looked down from heaven on the children of men: to see if there were any that did understand, or did seek God. \n", "4": " All have gone aside, they are become unprofitable together, there is none that doth good, no not one. \n", "5": " Shall not all the workers of iniquity know, who eat up my people as they eat bread? \n", "6": " They have not called upon God: there have they trembled for fear, where there was no fear. For <u>God hath scattered the bones</u> of them that please men: they have been confounded, because God hath despised them. \n", "7": " Who will give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? when God shall bring back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad. \n"}}

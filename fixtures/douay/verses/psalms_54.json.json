{"Psalms__54": {"1": " Unto the end, in verses, understanding for David. \n", "2": " Hear, O God, my prayer, and despise not my supplication: \n", "3": " Be attentive to me and hear me. I am grieved in my exercise; and am troubled, \n", "4": " At the voice of the enemy, and at the tribulation of the sinner. For they have cast iniquities upon me: and in wrath they were troublesome to me. \n", "5": " My heart is troubled within me: and the fear of death is fallen upon me. \n", "6": " Fear and trembling are come upon me: and darkness hath covered me. \n", "7": " And I said: Who will give me wings like a dove, and I will fly and be at rest? \n", "8": " Lo, I have gone far off flying away; and I abode in the wilderness. \n", "9": " I waited for him that hath saved me from pusillanimity of spirit, and a storm. \n", "10": " Cast down, O Lord, and divide their tongues; for I have seen iniquity and contradiction in the city. \n", "11": " Day and night shall iniquity surround it upon its walls: and in the midst thereof are labour, \n", "12": " And injustice. And usury and deceit have not departed from its streets. \n", "13": " For if my enemy had reviled me, I would verily have borne with it. And if he that hated me had spoken great things against me, I would perhaps have hidden myself from him. \n", "14": " But thou a man of one mind, my guide, and my familiar, \n", "15": " Who didst take sweetmeats together with me: in the house of God we walked with consent. \n", "16": " <u>Let death</u> come upon them, and let them go down alive into hell. For there is wickedness in their dwellings: in the midst of them. \n", "17": " But I have cried to God: and the Lord will save me. \n", "18": " Evening and morning, and at noon I will speak and declare: and he shall hear my voice. \n", "19": " He shall redeem my soul in peace from them that draw near to me: for <u>among many</u> they were with me. \n", "20": " God shall hear, and the Eternal shall humble them. For there is no change with them, and they have not feared God: \n", "21": " He hath stretched forth his hand to repay. They have defiled his covenant, \n", "22": " <u>They are divided</u> by the wrath Of his countenance, and his heart hath drawn near. His words are smoother than oil, and the same are darts. \n", "23": " Cast thy care upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee: he shall not suffer the just to waver for ever. \n", "24": " But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction. Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee, O Lord. \n"}}

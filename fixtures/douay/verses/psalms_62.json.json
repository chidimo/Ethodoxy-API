{"Psalms__62": {"1": " A psalm of David when he was in the desert of Edom. \n", "2": " O God, my God, to thee do I watch at break of day. For thee my soul hath thirsted; for thee my flesh, O how many ways! \n", "3": " In a desert land, and where there is no way, and no water: so in the sanctuary have I come before thee, to see thy power and thy glory. \n", "4": " For thy mercy is better than lives: thee my lips shall praise. \n", "5": " Thus will I bless thee all my life long: and in thy name I will lift up my hands. \n", "6": " Let my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness: and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips. \n", "7": " If I have remembered thee upon my bed, I will meditate on thee in the morning: \n", "8": " Because thou hast been my helper. And I will rejoice under the covert of thy wings: \n", "9": " My soul hath stuck close to thee: thy right hand hath received me. \n", "10": " But they have sought my soul in vain, they shall go into the lower parts of the earth: \n", "11": " They shall be delivered into the hands of the sword, they shall be the portions of foxes. \n", "12": " But the king shall rejoice in God, all they shall be praised that swear by him: because the mouth is stopped of them that speak wicked things. \n"}}

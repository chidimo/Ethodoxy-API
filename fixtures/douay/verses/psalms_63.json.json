{"Psalms__63": {"1": " Unto the end, a psalm for David. \n", "2": " Hear, O God, my prayer, when I make supplication to thee: deliver my soul from the fear of the enemy. \n", "3": " Thou hast protected me from the assembly of the malignant; from the multitude of the workers of iniquity. \n", "4": " For they have whetted their tongues like a sword; they have bent their bow a bitter thing, \n", "5": " To shoot in secret the undefiled. \n", "6": " They will shoot at him on a sudden, and will not fear: they are resolute in wickedness. They have talked of hiding snares; they have said: Who shall see them? \n", "7": " They have searched after iniquities: they have failed in their search. Man shall come to <u>a deep heart</u>: \n", "8": " And God shall be exalted. <u>The arrows of children are their wounds</u>: \n", "9": " And their tongues against them are made weak. All that saw them were troubled; \n", "10": " And every man was afraid. And they declared the works of God: and understood his doings. \n", "11": " The just shall rejoice in the Lord, and shall hope in him: and all the upright in heart shall be praised. \n"}}

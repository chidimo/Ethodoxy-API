{"Psalms__67": {"1": " Unto the end, a psalm of a canticle for David himself. \n", "2": " Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered: and let them that hate him flee from before his face. \n", "3": " As smoke vanisheth, so let them vanish away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God. \n", "4": " And let the just feast, and rejoice before God: and be delighted with gladness. \n", "5": " Sing ye to God, sing a psalm to his name, make a way for him <u>who ascendeth upon the west</u>: the Lord is his name. Rejoice ye before him: but the wicked shall be troubled at his presence, \n", "6": " Who is the father of orphans, and the judge of widows. God in his holy place: \n", "7": " God who maketh men <u>of one manner</u> to dwell in a house: Who bringeth out <u>them that were bound</u> in strength; in like manner them that provoke, that dwell in sepulchres. \n", "8": " O God, when thou didst go forth in the sight of thy people, when thou didst pass through the desert: \n", "9": " The earth was moved, and the heavens dropped at the presence of the God of Sina, at the presence of the God of Israel. \n", "10": " Thou shalt set aside for thy inheritance <u>a free rain</u>, O God: and it was weakened, but thou hast made it perfect. \n", "11": " <u>In it</u> shall thy animals dwell; in thy sweetness, O God, thou hast provided for the poor. \n", "12": " The Lord shall give the word <u>to them that preach good tidings</u> with great power. \n", "13": " <u>The king of powers</u> is of the beloved, of the beloved; and the beauty of the house shall divide spoils. \n", "14": " <u>If you sleep among the midst of lots</u>, you shall be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and the hinder parts of her back with the paleness of gold. \n", "15": " When he that is in heaven appointeth <u>kings over her</u>, they shall be whited with snow in Selmon. \n", "16": " <u>The mountain of God</u> is a fat mountain. A curdled mountain, a fat mountain. \n", "17": " <u>Why suspect, ye curdled mountains</u>? A mountain in which God is well pleased to dwell: for there the Lord shall dwell unto the end. \n", "18": " <u>The chariot of God</u> is attended by ten thousands; thousands of them that rejoice: the Lord is among them in Sina, in the holy place. \n", "19": " Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast <u>led captivity captive</u>; thou hast received gifts in men. Yea for those also that do not believe, the dwelling of the Lord God. \n", "20": " Blessed be the Lord day by day: the God of our salvation will make our journey prosperous to us. \n", "21": " Our God is the God of salvation: and of the Lord, of the Lord are <u>the issues from death</u>. \n", "22": " But God shall break the heads of his enemies: the hairy crown of them that walk on in their sins. \n", "23": " The Lord said: <u>I will turn them from Basan</u>, I will turn them into the depth of the sea: \n", "24": " That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thy enemies; the tongue of thy dogs be red with the same. \n", "25": " They have seen <u>thy goings</u>, O God, the goings of my God: of my king who is in his sanctuary. \n", "26": " <u>Princes</u> went before joined with singers, in the midst of young damsels playing on timbrels. \n", "27": " In the churches bless ye God the Lord, <u>from the fountains of Israel</u>. \n", "28": " There is Benjamin a youth, in ecstasy of mind. The princes of Juda are their leaders: the princes of Zabulon, the princes of Nephthali. \n", "29": " <u>Command thy strength</u>, O God: confirm, O God, what thou hast wrought in us. \n", "30": " From thy temple in Jerusalem, kings shall offer presents to thee. \n", "31": " <u>Rebuke the wild beasts of the reeds</u>, the congregation of bulls with the kine of the people; who seek to exclude them who are tried with silver. Scatter thou the nations that delight in wars: \n", "32": " <u>Ambassadors shall come</u> out of Egypt: Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands to God. \n", "33": " Sing to God, ye kingdoms of the earth: sing ye to the Lord: Sing ye to God, \n", "34": " Who mounteth above the heaven of heavens, <u>to the east</u>. Behold he will give to his voice <u>the voice of power</u>: \n", "35": " Give ye glory to God for Israel, his magnificence, and his power is in the clouds. \n", "36": " God is wonderful in his saints: the God of Israel is he who will give power and strength to his people. Blessed be God. \n"}}

{"Psalms__68": {"1": " Unto the end, <u>for them that shall be changed</u>; for David. \n", "2": " SAVE me, O God: for <u>the waters</u> are come in even unto my soul. \n", "3": " I stick fast in the mire of the deep: and there is no sure standing. I am come into the depth of the sea: and a tempest hath overwhelmed me. \n", "4": " I have laboured with crying; my jaws are become hoarse: my eyes have failed, whilst I hope in my God. \n", "5": " They are multiplied above the hairs of my head, who hate me without cause. My enemies are grown strong who have wrongfully persecuted me: then did <u>I pay that which I took not away</u>. \n", "6": " O God, thou knowest <u>my foolishness; and my offences</u> are not hidden from thee: \n", "7": " Let not them be ashamed for me, who look for thee, O Lord, the Lord of hosts. Let them not be confounded on my account, who seek thee, O God of Israel. \n", "8": " Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face. \n", "9": " I am become a stranger to my brethren, and an alien to the sons of my mother. \n", "10": " For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up: and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me. \n", "11": " And I covered my soul in fasting: and it was made a reproach to me. \n", "12": " And I made haircloth my garment: and I became a byword to them. \n", "13": " They that sat in the gate spoke against me: and they that drank wine made me their song. \n", "14": " But as for me, my prayer is to thee, O Lord; for the time of thy good pleasure, O God. In the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation. \n", "15": " Draw me out of the mire, that I may not stick fast: deliver me from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters. \n", "16": " Let not the tempest of water drown me, nor the deep swallow me up: and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me. \n", "17": " Hear me, O Lord, for thy mercy is kind; look upon me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies. \n", "18": " And turn not away thy face from thy servant: for I am in trouble, hear me speedily. \n", "19": " Attend to my soul, and deliver it: save me because of my enemies. \n", "20": " Thou knowest my reproach, and my confusion, and my shame. \n", "21": " In thy sight are all they that afflict me; my heart hath expected reproach and misery. And I looked for one that would grieve together with me, but there was none: and for one that would comfort me, and I found none. \n", "22": " And they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink. \n", "23": " <u>Let their table</u> become as a snare before them, and a recompense, and a stumblingblock. \n", "24": " Let their eyes be darkened that they see not; and their back bend thou down always. \n", "25": " Pour out thy indignation upon them: and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them. \n", "26": " Let their habitation be made desolate: and let there be none to dwell in their tabernacles. \n", "27": " Because they have persecuted him whom thou hast smitten; and they have added to the grief of my wounds. \n", "28": " Add thou iniquity upon their iniquity: and let them not come into thy justice. \n", "29": " Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; and with the just let them not be written. \n", "30": " But I am poor and sorrowful: thy salvation, O God, hath set me up. \n", "31": " I will praise the name of God with a canticle: and I will magnify him with praise. \n", "32": " And it shall please God better than a young calf, that bringeth forth horns and hoofs. \n", "33": " Let the poor see and rejoice: seek ye God, and your soul shall live. \n", "34": " For the Lord hath heard the poor: and hath not despised his prisoners. \n", "35": " Let the heavens and the earth praise him; the sea, and every thing that creepeth therein. \n", "36": " For God will save <u>Sion</u>, and the cities of Juda shall be built up. And they shall dwell there, and acquire it by inheritance. \n", "37": " And the seed of his servants shall possess it; and they that love his name shall dwell therein. \n"}}

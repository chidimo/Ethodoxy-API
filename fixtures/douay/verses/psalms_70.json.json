For thou art my firmament and my refuge. \n", "4": " Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the sinner, and out of the hand of the transgressor of the law and of the unjust. \n", "5": " For thou art my patience, O Lord: my hope, O Lord, from my youth; \n", "6": " By thee have I been confirmed from the womb: from my mother's womb thou art my protector. Of thee shall I continually sing: \n", "7": " I run become unto many as a wonder, but thou art a strong helper. \n", "8": " Let my mouth be filled with praise, that I may sing thy glory; thy greatness all the day long. \n", "9": " Cast me not off in the time of old age: when my strength shall fail, do not thou forsake me. \n", "10": " For my enemies have spoken against me; and they that watched my soul have consulted together, \n", "11": " Saying: God hath forsaken him: pursue and take him, for there is none to deliver him. \n", "12": " O God, be not thou far from me: O my God, make haste to my help. \n", "13": " Let them be confounded and come to nothing that detract my soul; let them be covered with confusion and shame that seek my hurt. \n", "14": " But I will always hope; and will add to all thy praise. \n", "15": " My mouth shall shew forth thy justice; thy salvation all the day long.

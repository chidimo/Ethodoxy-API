{"Psalms__73": {"1": " Understanding for Asaph. O God, why hast thou cast us off unto the end: why is thy wrath enkindled against the sheep of thy pasture? \n", "2": " Remember thy congregation, which thou hast possessed from the beginning. The sceptre of thy inheritance which thou hast redeemed: mount Sion in which thou hast dwelt. \n", "3": " Lift up thy hands against their pride unto the end; see what things the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary. \n", "4": " And they that hate thee have made their boasts, in the midst of thy solemnity. They have set up <u>their ensigns</u> for signs, \n", "5": " And they knew not both in the going out and on the highest top. As with axes in a wood of trees, \n", "6": " They have cut down at once the gates thereof, with axe and hatchet they have brought it down. \n", "7": " They have set fire to thy sanctuary: they have defiled the dwelling place of thy name on the earth. \n", "8": " They said in their heart, the whole kindred of them together: Let us abolish all the festival days of God from the land. \n", "9": " Our signs we have not seen, there is now no prophet: and he will know us no more. \n", "10": " How long, O God, shall the enemy reproach: is the adversary to provoke thy name for ever? \n", "11": " Why dost thou turn away thy hand: and thy right hand out of the midst of thy bosom for ever? \n", "12": " But God is our king before ages: he hath wrought salvation in the midst of the earth. \n", "13": " Thou by thy strength didst make <u>the sea firm</u>: thou didst crush the heads of the dragons in the waters. \n", "14": " Thou hast broken the heads of the dragon: thou hast given him to be meat for the people of the Ethiopians. \n", "15": " Thou hast broken up the fountains and the torrents: thou hast dried up the <u>Ethan rivers</u>. \n", "16": " Thine is the day, and thine is the night: thou hast made the morning light and the sun. \n", "17": " Thou hast made all the borders of the earth: the summer and the spring were formed by thee. \n", "18": " Remember this, the enemy hath reproached the Lord: and a foolish people hath provoked thy name. \n", "19": " Deliver not up to beasts the souls that confess to thee: and forget not to the end the souls of thy poor. \n", "20": " Have regard to thy covenant: for they that are <u>the obscure of the earth</u> have been filled with dwellings of iniquity. \n", "21": " Let not the humble be turned away with confusion: the poor and needy shall praise thy name. \n", "22": " Arise, O God, judge thy own cause: remember thy reproaches with which the foolish man hath reproached thee all the day. \n", "23": " Forget not the voices of thy enemies: the pride of them that hate thee ascendeth continually. \n"}}

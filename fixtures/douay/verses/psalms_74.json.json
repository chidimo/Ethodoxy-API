One he putteth down, and another he lifteth up: \n", "9": " For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup of strong wine full of mixture. And he hath poured it out from this to that: but the dregs thereof are not emptied: all the sinners of the earth shall drink. \n", "10": " But I will declare for ever: I will sing to the God of Jacob. \n", "11": " And I will break all the horns of sinners: but the horns of the just shall be exalted. \n"}}

{"Psalms__77": {"1": " Understanding for Asaph. Attend, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth. \n", "2": " I will open my mouth in parables: I will utter <u>propositions</u> from the beginning. \n", "3": " How great things have we heard and known, and our fathers have told us. \n", "4": " They have not been hidden from their children, in another generation. Declaring the praises of the Lord, and his powers, and his wonders which he hath done. \n", "5": " And he set up a testimony in Jacob: and made a law in Israel. How great things he commanded our fathers, that they should make the same known to their children: \n", "6": " That another generation might know them. The children that should be born and should rise up, and declare them to their children. \n", "7": " That they may put their hope in God and may not forget the works of God: and may seek his commandments. \n", "8": " That they may not become like their fathers, a perverse and exasperating generation. A generation that set not their heart aright: and whose spirit was not faithful to God. \n", "9": " The sons of Ephraim who bend and shoot with the bow: they have turned back in the day of battle. \n", "10": " They kept not the covenant of God: and in his law they would not walk. \n", "11": " And they forgot his benefits, and his wonders that he had shewn them. \n", "12": " Wonderful things did he do in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Tanis. \n", "13": " He divided the sea and brought them through: and he made the waters to stand as in a vessel. \n", "14": " And he conducted them with a cloud by day: and all the night with a light of fire. \n", "15": " He struck the rock in the wilderness: and gave them to drink, as out of the great deep. \n", "16": " He brought forth water out of the rock: and made streams run down as rivers. \n", "17": " And they added yet more sin against him: they provoked the most High to wrath in the place without water. \n", "18": " And they tempted God in their hearts, by asking meat for their desires. \n", "19": " And they spoke ill of God: they said: Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? \n", "20": " Because he struck the rock, and the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed. Can he also give bread, or provide a table for his people? \n", "21": " Therefore the Lord heard, and was angry: and a fire was kindled against Jacob, and wrath came up against Israel. \n", "22": " Because they believed not in God: and trusted not in his salvation. \n", "23": " And he had commanded the clouds from above, and had opened the doors of heaven. \n", "24": " And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them the bread of heaven. \n", "25": " Man ate the bread of angels: he sent them provisions in abundance. \n", "26": " He removed the south wind from heaven: and by his power brought in the southwest wind. \n", "27": " And he rained upon them flesh as dust: and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea. \n", "28": " And they fell in the midst of their camp, round about their pavilions. \n", "29": " So they did eat, and were filled exceedingly, and he gave them their desire: \n", "30": " They were not defrauded of that which they craved. As yet their meat was in their mouth: \n", "31": " And the wrath of God came upon them. And he slew the fat ones amongst them, and brought down the chosen men of Israel. \n", "32": " In all these things they sinned still: and they believed not for his wondrous works. \n", "33": " And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years in haste. \n", "34": " When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned, and came to him early in the morning. \n", "35": " And they remembered that God was their helper: and the most high God their redeemer. \n", "36": " And they loved him with their mouth: and with their tongue they lied unto him: \n", "37": " But their heart was not right with him: nor were they counted faithful in his covenant. \n", "38": " But he is merciful, and will forgive their sins: and will not destroy them. And many a time did he turn away his anger: and did not kindle all his wrath. \n", "39": " And he remembered that they are flesh: a wind that goeth and returneth not. \n", "40": " How often did they provoke him in the desert: and move him to wrath in the place without water? \n", "41": " And they turned back and tempted God: and grieved the holy one of Israel. \n", "42": " They remembered not his hand, in the day that he redeemed them from the hand of him that afflicted them: \n", "43": " How he wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Tanis. \n", "44": " And he turned their rivers into blood, and their showers that they might, not drink. \n", "45": " He sent amongst them divers sores of flies, which devoured them: and frogs which destroyed them. \n", "46": " And he gave up their fruits to the blast, and their labours to the locust. \n", "47": " And he destroyed their vineyards with hail, and their mulberry trees with hoarfrost. \n", "48": " And he gave up their cattle to the hail, and their stock to the fire. \n", "49": " And he sent upon them the wrath of his indignation: indignation and wrath and trouble, which he sent by evil angels. \n", "50": " He made a way for a path to his anger: he spared not their souls from death, and their cattle he shut up in death. \n", "51": " And he killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt: the firstfruits of all their labour in the tabernacles of Cham. \n", "52": " And he took away his own people as sheep: and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. \n", "53": " And he brought them out in hope, and they feared not: band the sea overwhelmed their enemies. \n", "54": " And he brought them into the mountain of his sanctuary: the mountain which his right hand had purchased. And he cast out the Gentiles before them: and by lot divided to them their land by a line of distribution. \n", "55": " And he made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tabernacles. \n", "56": " Yet they tempted, and provoked the most high God: and they kept not his testimonies. \n", "57": " And they turned away, and kept not the covenant: even like their fathers they were turned aside as a crooked bow. \n", "58": " They provoked him to anger on their hills: and moved him to jealousy with their graven things. \n", "59": " God heard, and despised them, and he reduced Israel exceedingly as it were to nothing. \n", "60": " And he put away the tabernacle of Silo, his tabernacle where he dwelt among men. \n", "61": " And he delivered their strength into captivity: and their beauty into the hands of the enemy. \n", "62": " And he shut up his people under the sword: and he despised his inheritance. \n", "63": " Fire consumed their young men: and their maidens were not lamented. \n", "64": " Their priests fell by the sword: and their widows did not mourn. \n", "65": " And the Lord was awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that hath been surfeited with wine. \n", "66": " And he smote his enemies on the hinder parts: he put them to an everlasting reproach. \n", "67": " And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph: and chose not the tribe of Ephraim: \n", "68": " But he chose the tribe of Juda, mount Sion which he loved. \n", "69": " And he built his sanctuary <u>as of unicorns</u>, in the land which he founded for ever. \n", "70": " And he chose his servant David, and took him from the flocks of sheep: he brought him from following the ewes great with young, \n", "71": " To feed Jacob his servant, and Israel his inheritance. \n", "72": " And he fed them in the innocence of his heart: and conducted them by the skillfulness of his hands. \n"}}

{"Psalms__87": {"1": " A canticle of a psalm for the sons of Core: unto the end, for <u>Maheleth</u>, to answer <u>understanding</u> of Eman the Ezrahite. \n", "2": " O Lord, the God of my salvation: I have cried in the day, and in the night before thee. \n", "3": " Let my prayer come in before thee: incline thy ear to my petition. \n", "4": " For my soul is filled with evils: and my life hath drawn nigh to hell. \n", "5": " I am counted among them that go down to the pit: I am become as a man without help, \n", "6": " Free among the dead. Like the slain sleeping in the sepulchres, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cast off from thy hand. \n", "7": " They have laid me in the lower pit: in the dark places, and in the shadow of death. \n", "8": " Thy wrath is strong over me: and all thy waves thou hast brought in upon me. \n", "9": " Thou hast put away my acquaintance far from me: they have set me an abomination to themselves. I was delivered up, and came not forth: \n", "10": " My eyes languished through poverty. All the day I cried to thee, O Lord: I stretched out my hands to thee. \n", "11": " Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? or shall physicians raise to life, and give praise to thee? \n", "12": " Shall any one in the sepulchre declare thy mercy: and thy truth in destruction? \n", "13": " Shall thy wonders be known in the dark; and thy justice in the land of forgetfulness? \n", "14": " But I, O Lord, have cried to thee: and in the morning my prayer shall prevent thee. \n", "15": " Lord, why castest thou off my prayer: why turnest thou away thy face from me? \n", "16": " I am poor, and in labours from my youth: and being exalted have been humbled and troubled. \n", "17": " Thy wrath hath come upon me: and thy terrors have troubled me. \n", "18": " They have come round about me like water all the day: they have compassed me about together. \n", "19": " Friend and neighbour thou hast put far from me: and my acquaintance, because of misery. \n"}}

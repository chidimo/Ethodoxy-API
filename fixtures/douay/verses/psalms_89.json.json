{"Psalms__89": {"1": " A prayer of Moses the man of God. Lord, thou hast been our refuge from generation to generation. \n", "2": " Before the mountains were made, or the earth and the world was formed; from eternity and to eternity thou art God. \n", "3": " <u>Turn not man away</u> to be brought low: and thou hast said: Be converted, O ye sons of men. \n", "4": " For a thousand years in thy sight are as yesterday, which is past. And as a watch in the night, \n", "5": " Things that are counted nothing, shall their years be. \n", "6": " In the morning man shall grow up like grass; in the morning he shall flourish and pass away: in the evening he shall fall, grow dry, and wither. \n", "7": " For in thy wrath we have fainted away: and are troubled in thy indignation. \n", "8": " Thou hast set our iniquities before thy eyes: our life in the light of thy countenance. \n", "9": " For all our days are spent; and in thy wrath we have fainted away. Our years shall be considered <u>as a spider</u>: \n", "10": " The days of our years in them are threescore and ten years. But if in the strong they be fourscore years: and what is more of them is labour and sorrow. For <u>mildness is come upon us</u>: and we shall be corrected. \n", "11": " Who knoweth the power of thy anger, and for thy fear \n", "12": " Can number thy wrath? So make thy right hand known: and men learned in heart, in wisdom. \n", "13": " Return, O Lord, how long? and be entreated in favour of thy servants. \n", "14": " We are filled in the morning with thy mercy: and we have rejoiced, and are delighted all our days. \n", "15": " We have rejoiced for the days in which thou hast humbled us: for the years in which we have seen evils. \n", "16": " Look upon thy servants and upon their works: and direct their children. \n", "17": " And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us: and direct thou the works of our hands over us; yea, the work of our hands do thou direct. \n"}}

For he hath corrected the world, which shall not be moved: he will judge the people with justice. \n", "11": " Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad, let the sea be moved, and the fulness thereof: \n", "12": " The fields and all things that are in them shall be joyful. Then shall all the trees of the woods rejoice \n", "13": " Before the face of the Lord, because he cometh: because he cometh to judge the earth. He shall judge the world with justice, and the people with his truth. \n"}}

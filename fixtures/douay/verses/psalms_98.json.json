The Lord hath reigned, <u>let the people be angry</u>: he that sitteth on the cherubims: let the earth be moved. \n", "2": " The Lord is great in Sion, and high above all people. \n", "3": " Let them give praise to thy great name: for it is terrible and holy: \n", "4": " And the king's honour <u>loveth judgment</u>. Thou hast prepared <u>directions</u>: thou hast done judgment and justice in Jacob. \n", "5": " Exalt ye the Lord our God, and <u>adore his footstool</u>, for it is holy. \n", "6": " <u>Moses and Aaron among his priests</u>: and Samuel among them that call upon his name. They called upon the Lord, and he heard them: \n", "7": " He spoke to them in the pillar of the cloud. They kept his testimonies, and the commandment which he gave them. \n", "8": " Thou didst hear them, O Lord our God: thou wast a merciful God to them, and taking vengeance on <u>all their inventions</u>. \n", "9": " Exalt ye the Lord our God, and adore at his holy mountain: for the Lord our God is holy. \n"}}

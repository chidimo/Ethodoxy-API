{"Romans__02": {"1": " Wherefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest. For wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself. For thou dost the same things which thou judgest. \n", "2": " For we know that the judgment of God is, according to truth, against them that do such things. \n", "3": " And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them who do such things, and dost the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God? \n", "4": " Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness, and patience, and longsuffering? Knowest thou not, that the benignity of God leadeth thee to penance? \n", "5": " But according to thy hardness and impenitent heart, thou treasurest up to thyself wrath, against the day of wrath, and revelation of the just judgment of God. \n", "6": " Who will render to every man according to his works. \n", "7": " To them indeed, who according to patience in good work, seek glory and honour and incorruption, eternal life: \n", "8": " But to them that are contentious, and who obey not the truth, but give credit to iniquity, wrath and indignation. \n", "9": " Tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that worketh evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Greek. \n", "10": " But glory, and honour, and peace to every one that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. \n", "11": " For there is no respect of persons with God. \n", "12": " For whosoever have sinned without the law, shall perish without the law; and whosoever have sinned in the law, shall be judged by the law. \n", "13": " For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified. \n", "14": " For when the Gentiles, who have not the law, do by nature those things that are of the law; these having not the law are a law to themselves: \n", "15": " Who shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience bearing witness to them, and their thoughts between themselves accusing, or also defending one another, \n", "16": " In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel. \n", "17": " But if thou art called a Jew and restest in the law, and makest thy boast of God, \n", "18": " And knowest his will, and approvest the more profitable things, being instructed by the law, \n", "19": " Art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of them that are in darkness, \n", "20": " An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of infants, having the form of knowledge and of truth in the law. \n", "21": " Thou therefore that teachest another, teachest not thyself: thou that preachest that men should not steal, stealest: \n", "22": " Thou that sayest, men should not commit adultery, committest adultery: thou that abhorrest idols, committest sacrilege: \n", "23": " Thou that makest thy boast of the law, by transgression of the law dishonourest God. \n", "24": " (For the name of God through you is blasphemed among the Gentiles, as it is written.) \n", "25": " Circumcision profiteth indeed, if thou keep the law; but if thou be a transgressor of the law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision. \n", "26": " If, then, the uncircumcised keep the justices of the law, shall not this uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? \n", "27": " And shall not that which by nature is uncircumcision, if it fulfill the law, judge thee, who by the letter and circumcision art a transgressor of the law? \n", "28": " For it is not he is a Jew, who is so outwardly; nor is that circumcision which is outwardly in the flesh: \n", "29": " But he is a Jew, that is one inwardly; and the circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God. \n"}}

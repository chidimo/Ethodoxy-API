{"Romans__03": {"1": " What advantage then hath the Jew, or what is the profit of circumcision? \n", "2": " Much every way. First indeed, because the words of God were committed to them. \n", "3": " For what if some of them have not believed? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? God forbid. \n", "4": " But <u>God is true</u>; and every man a liar, as it is written, That thou mayest be justified in thy words, and mayest overcome when thou art judged. \n", "5": " But if our injustice commend the justice of God, what shall we say? Is God unjust, who executeth wrath? \n", "6": " (I speak according to man.) God forbid: otherwise how shall God judge this world? \n", "7": " For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie, unto his glory, why am I also yet judged as a sinner? \n", "8": " And not rather (as we are slandered, and as some affirm that we say) let us do evil, that there may come good? whose damnation is just. \n", "9": " What then? Do we excel them? No, not so. For we have charged both Jews, and Greeks, that they are all under sin. \n", "10": " As it is written: <u>There is not any man just</u>. \n", "11": " There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God. \n", "12": " All have turned out of the way; they are become unprofitable together: there is none that doth good, there is not so much as one. \n", "13": " Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have dealt deceitfully. The venom of asps is under their lips. \n", "14": " Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness: \n", "15": " Their feet swift to shed blood: \n", "16": " Destruction and misery in their ways: \n", "17": " And the way of peace they have not known: \n", "18": " There is no fear of God before their eyes. \n", "19": " Now we know, that what things soever the law speaketh, it speaketh to them that are in the law; that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may be made subject to God. \n", "20": " Because by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified before him. For by the law is the knowledge of sin. \n", "21": " But now without the law the justice of God is made manifest, being witnessed by the law and the prophets. \n", "22": " Even the justice of God, by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all them that believe in him: for there is no distinction: \n", "23": " For all have sinned, and do need the glory of God. \n", "24": " Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption, that is in Christ Jesus, \n", "25": " Whom God hath proposed to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, to the shewing of his justice, for the remission of former sins, \n", "26": " Through the forbearance of God, for the shewing of his justice in this time; that he himself may be just, and the justifier of him, who is of the faith of Jesus Christ. \n", "27": " Where is then thy boasting? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith. \n", "28": " For we account a man to be justified <u>by faith</u>, without the works of the law. \n", "29": " Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also. \n", "30": " For it is one God, that justifieth circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith. \n", "31": " Do we, then, destroy the law through faith? God forbid: but we establish the law. \n"}}

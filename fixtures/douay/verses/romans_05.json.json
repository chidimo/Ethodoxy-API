{"Romans__05": {"1": " Being justified therefore by faith, let us have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ: \n", "2": " By whom also we have access through faith into this grace, wherein we stand, and glory in the hope of the glory of the sons of God. \n", "3": " And not only so; but we glory also in tribulations, knowing that tribulation worketh patience; \n", "4": " And patience trial; and trial hope; \n", "5": " And hope confoundeth not: because the charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost, who is given to us. \n", "6": " For why did Christ, when as yet we were weak, according to the time, die for the ungodly? \n", "7": " For scarce for a just man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man some one would dare to die. \n", "8": " But God commendeth his charity towards us; because when as yet we were sinners, according to the time, \n", "9": " Christ died for us; much more therefore, being now justified by his blood, shall we be saved from wrath through him. \n", "10": " For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son; much more, being reconciled, shall we be saved by his life. \n", "11": " And not only so; but also we glory in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received reconciliation. \n", "12": " Wherefore as <u>by one man</u> sin entered into this world, and by sin death; and so death passed upon all men, in whom all have sinned. \n", "13": " For until the law sin was in the world; but sin was <u>not imputed</u>, when the law was not. \n", "14": " But death reigned from Adam unto Moses, even over them also who have not sinned after the similitude of the transgression of Adam, who is a figure of him who was to come. \n", "15": " But not as the offence, so also the gift. For if by the offence of one, many died; much more the grace of God, and the gift, by the grace of one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. \n", "16": " And not as it was by one sin, so also is the gift. For judgment indeed was by one unto condemnation; but grace is of many offences, unto justification. \n", "17": " For if by one man's offence death reigned through one; much more they who receive abundance of grace, and of the gift, and of justice, shall reign in life through one, Jesus Christ. \n", "18": " Therefore, as by the offence of one, unto all men to condemnation; so also by the justice of one, unto all men to justification of life. \n", "19": " For as by the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners; so also by the obedience of one, many shall be made just. \n", "20": " Now the law entered in, <u>that sin might abound</u>. And where sin abounded, grace did more abound. \n", "21": " That as sin hath reigned to death; so also grace might reign by justice unto life everlasting, through Jesus Christ our Lord. \n"}}

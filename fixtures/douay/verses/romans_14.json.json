{"Romans__14": {"1": " Now him that is weak in faith, take unto you: not in disputes about thoughts. \n", "2": " For one believeth that he may <u>eat all things</u>: but he that is weak, let him eat herbs. \n", "3": " Let not him that eateth, despise him that eateth not: and he that eateth not, let him not judge him that eateth. For God hath taken him to him. \n", "4": " Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? To his own lord he standeth or falleth. And he shall stand: for God is able to make him stand. \n", "5": " For one judgeth <u>between day</u> and day: and another judgeth every day: let every man abound in his own sense. \n", "6": " He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord. And he that eateth, eateth to the Lord: for he giveth thanks to God. And he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth thanks to God. \n", "7": " For none of us liveth to himself; and no man dieth to himself. \n", "8": " For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; or whether we die, we die unto the Lord. Therefore, whether we live, or whether we die, we are the Lord's. \n", "9": " For to this end Christ died and rose again; that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living. \n", "10": " But thou, why judgest thou thy brother? or thou, why dost thou despise thy brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. \n", "11": " For it is written: As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. \n", "12": " Therefore every one of us shall render account to God for himself. \n", "13": " Let us not therefore judge one another any more. But judge this rather, that you put not a stumblingblock or a scandal in your brother's way. \n", "14": " I know, and am confident in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself; but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean. \n", "15": " For if, because of thy meat, thy brother be grieved, thou walkest not now according to charity. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died. \n", "16": " Let not then our good be evil spoken of. \n", "17": " For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but justice, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. \n", "18": " For he that in this serveth Christ, pleaseth God, and is approved of men. \n", "19": " Therefore let us follow after the things that are of peace; and keep the things that are of edification one towards another. \n", "20": " Destroy not the work of God for meat. All things indeed are clean: but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence. \n", "21": " It is good not to eat flesh, and not to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother is offended, or scandalized, or made weak. \n", "22": " Hast thou faith? Have it to thyself before God. Blessed is he that condemneth not himself in that which he alloweth. \n", "23": " But he that <u>discerneth</u>, if he eat, is condemned; because not <u>of faith</u>. For all that is not of faith is sin. \n"}}

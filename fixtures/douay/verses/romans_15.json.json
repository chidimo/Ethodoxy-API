{"Romans__15": {"1": " Now we that are stronger, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. \n", "2": " Let every one of you please his neighbour unto good, to edification. \n", "3": " For Christ did not please himself, but as it is written: The reproaches of them that reproached thee, fell upon me. \n", "4": " For what things soever were written, were written for our learning: that through patience and the comfort of the scriptures, we might have hope. \n", "5": " Now the God of patience and of comfort grant you to be of one mind one towards another, according to Jesus Christ: \n", "6": " That with one mind, and with one mouth, you may glorify God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. \n", "7": " Wherefore receive one another, as Christ also hath received you unto the honour of God. \n", "8": " For I say that Christ Jesus was <u>minister of the circumcision</u> for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers. \n", "9": " But that the Gentiles are to glorify God for his mercy, as it is written: Therefore will I confess to thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles, and will sing to thy name. \n", "10": " And again he saith: Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people. \n", "11": " And again: Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and magnify him, all ye people. \n", "12": " And again Isaias saith: There shall be a root of Jesse; and he that shall rise up to rule the Gentiles, in him the Gentiles shall hope. \n", "13": " Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing; that you may abound in hope, and in the power of the Holy Ghost. \n", "14": " And I myself also, my brethren, am assured of you, that you also are full of love, replenished with all knowledge, so that you are able to admonish one another. \n", "15": " But I have written to you, brethren, more boldly in some sort, as it were putting you in mind: because of the grace which is given me from God. \n", "16": " That I should be the minister of Christ Jesus among the Gentiles; sanctifying the gospel of God, that the oblation of the Gentiles may be made acceptable and sanctified in the Holy Ghost. \n", "17": " I have therefore glory in Christ Jesus towards God. \n", "18": " For I dare not to speak of any of those things which Christ worketh not by me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed, \n", "19": " By the virtue of signs and wonders, in the power of the Holy Ghost, so that from Jerusalem round about as far as unto Illyricum, I have replenished the gospel of Christ. \n", "20": " And I have so preached this gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation. \n", "21": " But as it is written: They to whom he was not spoken of, shall see, and they that have not heard shall understand. \n", "22": " For which cause also I was hindered very much from coming to you, and have been kept away till now. \n", "23": " But now having no more place in these countries, and having a great desire these many years past to come unto you, \n", "24": " When I shall begin to take my journey into Spain, I hope that as I pass, I shall see you, and be brought on my way thither by you, if first, in part, I shall have enjoyed you: \n", "25": " But now I shall go to Jerusalem, to minister unto the saints. \n", "26": " For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a contribution for the poor of the saints that are in Jerusalem. \n", "27": " For it hath pleased them; and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they ought also in carnal things to minister to them. \n", "28": " When therefore I shall have accomplished this, and consigned to them this fruit, I will come by you into Spain. \n", "29": " And I know, that when I come to you, I shall come in the abundance of the blessing of the gospel of Christ. \n", "30": " I beseech you therefore, brethren, through our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the charity of the Holy Ghost, that you help me in your prayers for me to God, \n", "31": " That I may be delivered from the unbelievers that are in Judea, and that the oblation of my service may be acceptable in Jerusalem to the saints. \n", "32": " That I may come to you with joy, by the will of God, and may be refreshed with you. \n", "33": " Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen. \n"}}

{"Solomon or Canticles__02": {"1": " <u>I am the flower of the field</u>, and the lily of the valleys. \n", "2": " As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters. \n", "3": " As the apple tree among the trees of the woods, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow, whom I desired: and his fruit was sweet to my palate. \n", "4": " He brought me into the cellar of wine, he set in order charity in me. \n", "5": " Stay me up with flowers, compass me about with apples: because I languish with love. \n", "6": " His left hand is under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me. \n", "7": " I adjure you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and the harts of the, fields, that you stir not up, nor make the beloved to awake, till she please. \n", "8": " <u>The voice of my beloved</u>, behold he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping over the hills. \n", "9": " My beloved is like a roe, or a young hart. Behold he standeth behind our wall, looking through the windows, looking through the lattices. \n", "10": " Behold my beloved speaketh to me: Arise, make haste, my love, my dove, my beautiful one, and come. \n", "11": " For winter is now past, the rain is over and gone. \n", "12": " The flowers have appeared in our land, the time of pruning is come: the voice of the turtle is heard in our land: \n", "13": " The fig tree hath put forth her green figs: the vines in flower yield their sweet smell. Arise, my love, my beautiful one, and come: \n", "14": " My dove in the clefts of the rock, in the hollow places of the wall, shew me thy face, let thy voice sound in my ears: for thy voice is sweet, and thy face comely. \n", "15": " <u>Catch us the little foxes</u> that destroy the vines: for our vineyard hath flourished. \n", "16": " My beloved to me, and I to him who feedeth among the lilies, \n", "17": " Till the day break, and the shadows retire. Return: be like, my beloved, to a roe, or to a young hart upon the mountains of Bether. \n"}}

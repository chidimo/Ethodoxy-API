{"Solomon or Canticles__04": {"1": " <u>How beautiful art thou</u>, my love, how beautiful art thou! thy eyes are doves' eyes, besides what is hid within. Thy hair is as flocks of goats, which Come up from mount Galaad. \n", "2": " Thy teeth as flocks of sheep, that are shorn which come up from the washing, all with twins, and there is none barren among them. \n", "3": " Thy lips are as a scarlet lace: and thy speech sweet. Thy cheeks are as a piece of a pomegranate, besides that which lieth hid within. \n", "4": " Thy neck, is as the tower of David, which is built with bulwarks: a thousand bucklers hang upon it, all the armour of valiant men. \n", "5": " <u>Thy two breasts</u> like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies. \n", "6": " Till the day break, and the shadows retire, I will go to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense. \n", "7": " Thou art all fair, O my love, and there is not a spot in thee. \n", "8": " Come from Libanus, my spouse, come from Libanus, come: thou shalt be crowned from the top of Amana, from the top of Sanir and Hermon, from the dens of the lions, from the mountains of the leopards. \n", "9": " Thou hast wounded my heart, my sister, my spouse, thou hast wounded my heart with one of thy eyes, and with one hair of thy neck. \n", "10": " How beautiful are thy breasts, my sister, my spouse! thy breasts are more beautiful than wine, and the sweet smell of thy ointments above all aromatical spices. \n", "11": " Thy lips, my spouse, are as a dropping honeycomb, honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments, as the smell of frankincense. \n", "12": " My sister, my spouse, is <u>a garden enclosed</u>, a garden enclosed, <u>a fountain sealed up</u>. \n", "13": " Thy plants are a paradise of pomegranates with the fruits of the orchard. Cypress with spikenard. \n", "14": " Spikenard and saffron, sweet cane and cinnamon, with all the trees of Libanus, myrrh and aloes with all the chief perfumes. \n", "15": " The fountain of gardens: the well of living waters, which run with a strong stream from Libanus. \n", "16": " Arise, O north wind, and come, O south wind, blow through my garden, and let the aromatical spices thereof flow. \n"}}

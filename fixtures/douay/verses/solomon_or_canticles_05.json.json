{"Solomon or Canticles__05": {"1": " <u>Let my beloved come into his garden</u>, and eat the fruit of his apple trees. I am come into my garden, O my sister, my spouse, I have gathered my myrrh, with my aromatical spices: I have eaten the honeycomb with my honey, I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends, and drink, and be inebriated, my dearly beloved. \n", "2": " I sleep, and my heart watcheth; the voice of my beloved knocking: Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is full of dew, and my locks of the drops of the nights. \n", "3": " I have put off my garment, how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them? \n", "4": " <u>My beloved put his hand through the key hole</u>, and my bowels were moved at his touch. \n", "5": " I arose up to open to my beloved: my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers were full of the choicest myrrh. \n", "6": " I opened the bolt of my door to my beloved: but he had turned aside, and was gone. My soul melted when he spoke: I sought him, and found him not: I called, and he did not answer me. \n", "7": " The keepers that go about the city found me: they struck me: and wounded me: the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me. \n", "8": " I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him that I languish with love. \n", "9": " What manner of one is thy beloved of the beloved, O thou most beautiful among women? what manner of one is thy beloved of the beloved, that thou hast so adjured us? \n", "10": " <u>My beloved</u> is white and ruddy, chosen out of thousands. \n", "11": " His head is as the finest gold: his locks as branches of palm trees, black as a raven. \n", "12": " His eyes as doves upon brooks of waters, which are washed with milk, and sit beside the plentiful streams. \n", "13": " His cheeks are as beds of aromatical spices set by the perfumers. His lips are as lilies dropping choice myrrh. \n", "14": " His hands are turned and as of gold, full of hyacinths. His belly as of ivory, set with sapphires. \n", "15": " His legs as pillars of marble, that are set upon bases of gold. His form as of Libanus, excellent as the cedars. \n", "16": " His throat most sweet, and he is all lovely: such is my beloved, and he is my friend, O ye daughters of Jerusalem. \n", "17": " Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou most beautiful among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside, and we will seek him with thee? \n"}}

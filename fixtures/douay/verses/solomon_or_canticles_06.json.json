{"Solomon or Canticles__06": {"1": " <u>My beloved is gone down into his garden</u>, to the bed of aromatical spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies. \n", "2": " I to my beloved, and my beloved to me, who feedeth among the lilies. \n", "3": " Thou art beautiful, O my love, sweet and comely as Jerusalem: terrible as an army set in array. \n", "4": " Turn away thy eyes from me, for they have made me flee away. Thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from Galaad. \n", "5": " Thy teeth as a flock of sheep, which come up from the washing, all with twins, and there is none barren among them. \n", "6": " Thy cheeks are as the bark of a pomegranate, beside what is hidden within thee. \n", "7": " There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and young maidens without number. \n", "8": " <u>One is my dove</u>, my perfect one is but one, she is the only one of her mother, the chosen of her that bore her. The daughters saw her, and declared her most blessed: the queens and concubines, and they praised her. \n", "9": " <u>Who is she</u> that cometh forth as the morning rising, fair as the moon, bright as the sun, terrible as an army set in array? \n", "10": " I went down into the garden of nuts, to see the fruits of the valleys, and to look if the vineyard had flourished, and the pomegranates budded. \n", "11": " I knew not: my soul troubled me for the chariots of Aminadab. \n", "12": " Return, return, O Sulamitess: return, return that we may behold thee. \n"}}

{"Titus__03": {"1": " Admonish them to be subject to princes and powers, to obey at a word, to be ready to every good work. \n", "2": " To speak evil of no man, not to be litigious, but gentle: shewing all mildness towards all men. \n", "3": " For we ourselves also were some time unwise, incredulous, erring, slaves to divers desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another. \n", "4": " But when the goodness and kindness of God our Saviour appeared: \n", "5": " Not by the works of justice, which we have done, but according to his mercy, he saved us, by the laver of regeneration, and renovation of the Holy Ghost; \n", "6": " Whom he hath poured forth upon us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour: \n", "7": " That, being justified by his grace, we may be heirs, according to hope of life everlasting. \n", "8": " It is a faithful saying: and these things I will have thee affirm constantly: that they, who believe in God, may be careful to excel in good works. These things are good and profitable unto men. \n", "9": " But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law. For they are unprofitable and vain. \n", "10": " A man that is a heretic, after the first and second admonition, avoid: \n", "11": " Knowing that he, that is such an one, is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned <u>by his own judgment</u>. \n", "12": " When I shall send to thee Artemas or Tychicus, make haste to come unto me to Nicopolis. For there I have determined to winter. \n", "13": " Send forward Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollo, with care, that nothing be wanting to them. \n", "14": " And let our men also learn to excel in good works for necessary uses: that they be not unfruitful. \n", "15": " All that are with me salute thee: salute them that love us in the faith. The grace of God be with you all. Amen. \n"}}

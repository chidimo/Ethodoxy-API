{"Wisdom *__03": {"1": " But the souls of the just are in the hand of God, and the torment of death shall not touch them. \n", "2": " In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die: and their departure was taken for misery: \n", "3": " And their going away from us, for utter destruction: but they are in peace. \n", "4": " And though in the sight of men they suffered torments, their hope is full of immortality. \n", "5": " Afflicted in few things, in many they shall be well rewarded: because God hath tried them, and found them worthy of himself. \n", "6": " As gold in the furnace he hath proved them, and as a victim of a holocaust he hath received them, and in time there shall be respect had to them. \n", "7": " The just shall shine, and shall run to and fro like sparks among the reeds. \n", "8": " They shall judge nations, and rule over people, and their Lord shall reign for ever. \n", "9": " They that trust in him, shall understand the truth: and they that are faithful in love shall rest in him: for grace and peace is to his elect. \n", "10": " But the wicked shall be punished according to their own devices: who have neglected the just, and have revolted from the Lord. \n", "11": " For he that rejecteth wisdom, and discipline, is unhappy: and their hope is vain, and their labours without fruit, and their works unprofitable. \n", "12": " Their wives are foolish, and their children wicked. \n", "13": " Their offspring is cursed: for happy is the barren: and the undefiled, that hath not known bed in sin: she shall have fruit in the visitation of holy souls. \n", "14": " And the eunuch, that hath not wrought iniquity with his hands, nor thought wicked things against God: for the precious gift of faith shall be given to him, and a most acceptable lot in the temple of God. \n", "15": " For the fruit of good labours is glorious, and the root of wisdom never faileth. \n", "16": " But the children of adulterers shall not come to perfection, and the seed of the unlawful bed shall be rooted out. \n", "17": " And if they live long, they shall be nothing regarded, and their last old age shall be without honour. \n", "18": " And if they die quickly, they shall have no hope, nor speech of comfort in the day of trial. \n", "19": " For dreadful are the ends of a wicked race. \n"}}

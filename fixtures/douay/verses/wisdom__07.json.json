{"Wisdom *__07": {"1": " I myself also am a mortal man, like all others, and of the race of him, that was first made of the earth, and in the womb of my mother I was fashioned to be flesh. \n", "2": " In the time of ten months I was compacted in blood, of the seed of man, and the pleasure of sleep concurring. \n", "3": " And being born I drew in the common air, and fell upon the earth, that is made alike, and the first voice which I uttered was crying, as all others do. \n", "4": " I was nursed in swaddling clothes, and with great cares. \n", "5": " For none of the kings had any other beginning of birth. \n", "6": " For all men have one entrance into life, and the like going out. \n", "7": " Wherefore I wished, and understanding was given me: and I called upon God, and the spirit of wisdom came upon me: \n", "8": " And I preferred her before kingdoms and thrones, and esteemed riches nothing in comparison of her. \n", "9": " Neither did I compare unto her any precious stone: for all gold in comparison of her, is as a little sand, and silver in respect to her shall be counted as clay. \n", "10": " I loved her above health and beauty, and chose to have her instead of light: for her light cannot be put out. \n", "11": " Now all good things came to me together with her, and innumerable riches through her hands, \n", "12": " And I rejoiced in all these: for this wisdom went before me, and I knew not that she was the mother of them all. \n", "13": " Which I have learned without guile, and communicate without envy, and her riches I hide not. \n", "14": " For she is an infinite treasure to men! which they that use, become the friends of God, being commended for the gift of discipline. \n", "15": " And God hath given to me to speak as I would, and to conceive thoughts worthy of those things that are given me: because he is the guide of wisdom, and the director of the wise: \n", "16": " For in his hand are both we, and our words, and all wisdom, and the knowledge and skill of works. \n", "17": " For he hath given me the true knowledge of the things that are: to know the disposition of the whole world, and the virtues of the elements, \n", "18": " The beginning, and ending, and midst of the times, the alterations of their courses, and the changes of seasons, \n", "19": " The revolutions of the year, and the dispositions of the stars, \n", "20": " The natures of living creatures, and rage of wild beasts, the force of winds, and reasonings of men, the diversities of plants, and the virtues of roots, \n", "21": " And all such things as are hid and not foreseen, I have learned: for wisdom, which is the worker of all things, taught me. \n", "22": " For in her is the spirit of understanding: holy, one, manifold, subtile, eloquent, active, undefiled, sure, sweet, loving that which is good, quick, which nothing hindereth, beneficent, \n", "23": " Gentle, kind, steadfast, assured, secure, having all power, overseeing all things, and containing all spirits, intelligible, pure, subtile. \n", "24": " For wisdom is more active than all active things: and reacheth everywhere by reason of her purity. \n", "25": " For she is a vapour of the power of God, and a certain pure emanation of the glory of the almighty God: and therefore no defiled thing cometh into her. \n", "26": " For she is the brightness of eternal light, and the unspotted mirror of God's majesty, and the image of his goodness. \n", "27": " And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in herself the same, she reneweth all things, and through nations conveyeth herself into holy souls, she maketh the friends of God and prophets. \n", "28": " For God loveth none but him that dwelleth with wisdom. \n", "29": " For she is more beautiful than the sun, and above all the order of the stars: being compared with the light, she is found before it. \n", "30": " For after this cometh night, but no evil can overcome wisdom. \n"}}

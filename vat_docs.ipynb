      "What we have seen and heard we announce to you, so that you may have fellowship \n",
      "with us and our common fellowship be with the Father and His Son Jesus Christ\" \n",
      "(1 John 1:2-3). Therefore, following in the footsteps of the Council of Trent \n",
      "and of the First Vatican Council, this present council wishes to set forth \n",
      "authentic doctrine on divine revelation and how it is handed on, so that by \n",
      "hearing the message of salvation the whole world may believe, by believing it \n",

      "Word made flesh, man might in the Holy Spirit have access to the Father and come \n",
      "to share in the divine nature (see Eph. 2:18; 2 Peter 1:4). Through this \n",
      "revelation, therefore, the invisible God (see Col. 1;15, 1 Tim. 1:17) out of the \n",
      "abundance of His love speaks to men as friends (see Ex. 33:11; John 15:14-15) \n",
      "and lives among them (see Bar. 3:38), so that He may invite and take them into \n",
      "fellowship with Himself. This plan of revelation is realized by deeds and words \n",
      "having an inner unity: the deeds wrought by God in the history of salvation \n",
      "manifest and confirm the teaching and realities signified by the words, while \n",
      "the words proclaim the deeds and clarify the mystery contained in them. By this \n",
      "revelation then, the deepest truth about God and the salvation of man shines out \n",
      "for our sake in Christ, who is both the mediator and the fullness of all \n",
      "revelation. (2)</p>\n",
      "<p>3. God, who through the Word creates all things (see John 1:3) and keeps them \n",
      "in existence, gives men an enduring witness to Himself in created realities (see \n",
      "Rom. 1:19-20). Planning to make known the way of heavenly salvation, He went \n",
      "further and from the start manifested Himself to our first parents. Then after \n",
      "their fall His promise of redemption aroused in them the hope of being saved \n",
      "(see Gen. 3:15) and from that time on He ceaselessly kept the human race in His \n",
      "care, to give eternal life to those who perseveringly do good in search of \n",
      "salvation (see Rom. 2:6-7). Then, at the time He had appointed He called Abraham \n",
      "in order to make of him a great nation (see Gen. 12:2). Through the patriarchs, \n",
      "and after them through Moses and the prophets, He taught this people to \n",
      "acknowledge Himself the one living and true God, provident father and just \n",
      "judge, and to wait for the Savior promised by Him, and in this manner prepared \n",
      "the way for the Gospel down through the centuries.</p>\n",
      "<p>4. Then, after speaking in many and varied ways through the prophets, \"now at \n",
      "last in these days God has spoken to us in His Son\" (Heb. 1:1-2). For He sent \n",
      "His Son, the eternal Word, who enlightens all men, so that He might dwell among \n",
      "men and tell them of the innermost being of God (see John 1:1-18). Jesus Christ, \n",
      "therefore, the Word made flesh, was sent as \"a man to men.\" (3) He \"speaks the \n",
      "words of God\" (John 3;34), and completes the work of salvation which His Father \n",
      "gave Him to do (see John 5:36; John 17:4). To see Jesus is to see His Father \n",
      "(John 14:9). For this reason Jesus perfected revelation by fulfilling it through \n",
      "his whole work of making Himself present and manifesting Himself: through His \n",
      "words and deeds, His signs and wonders, but especially through His death and \n",
      "glorious resurrection from the dead and final sending of the Spirit of truth. \n",
      "Moreover He confirmed with divine testimony what revelation proclaimed, that God \n",
      "is with us to free us from the darkness of sin and death, and to raise us up to \n",
      "life eternal.</p>\n",
      "<p>The Christian dispensation, therefore, as the new and definitive covenant, \n",

      "act of faith, the grace of God and the interior help of the Holy Spirit must \n",

      "the understanding of the human mind. (6)</p>\n",
      "<p>As a sacred synod has affirmed, God, the beginning and end of all things, can \n",

      "the salvation of all nations would abide perpetually in its full integrity and \n",
      "be handed on to all generations. Therefore Christ the Lord in whom the full \n",
      "revelation of the supreme God is brought to completion (see 2 Cor. 1:20; 3:13; \n",
      "4:6), commissioned the Apostles to preach to all men that Gospel which is the \n",
      "source of all saving truth and moral teaching, (1) and to impart to them \n",
      "heavenly gifts. This Gospel had been promised in former times through the \n",
      "prophets, and Christ Himself had fulfilled it and promulgated it with His lips. \n",
      "This commission was faithfully fulfilled by the Apostles who, by their oral \n",
      "preaching, by example, and by observances handed on what they had received from \n",
      "the lips of Christ, from living with Him, and from what He did, or what they had \n",
      "learned through the prompting of the Holy Spirit. The commission was fulfilled, \n",
      "too, by those Apostles and apostolic men who under the inspiration of the same \n",
      "Holy Spirit committed the message of salvation to writing. (2)</p>\n",
      "<p>But in order to keep the Gospel forever whole and alive within the Church, \n",
      "the Apostles left bishops as their successors, \"handing over\" to them \"the \n",
      "authority to teach in their own place.\"(3) This sacred tradition, therefore, and \n",
      "Sacred Scripture of both the Old and New Testaments are like a mirror in which \n",
      "the pilgrim Church on earth looks at God, from whom she has received everything, \n",
      "until she is brought finally to see Him as He is, face to face (see 1 John 3:2).</p>\n",
      "<p>8. And so the apostolic preaching, which is expressed in a special way in the \n",
      "inspired books, was to be preserved by an unending succession of preachers until \n",
      "the end of time. Therefore the Apostles, handing on what they themselves had \n",
      "received, warn the faithful to hold fast to the traditions which they have \n",
      "learned either by word of mouth or by letter (see 2 Thess. 2:15), and to fight \n",
      "in defense of the faith handed on once and for all (see Jude 1:3) (4) Now what \n",
      "was handed on by the Apostles includes everything which contributes toward the \n",
      "holiness of life and increase in faith of the peoples of God; and so the Church, \n",
      "in her teaching, life and worship, perpetuates and hands on to all generations \n",

      "centuries succeed one another, the Church constantly moves forward toward the \n",
      "fullness of divine truth until the words of God reach their complete fulfillment \n",
      "in her.</p>\n",
      "<p>The words of the holy fathers witness to the presence of this living \n",

      "and praying Church. Through the same tradition the Church's full canon of the \n",
      "sacred books is known, and the sacred writings themselves are more profoundly \n",
      "understood and unceasingly made active in her; and thus God, who spoke of old, \n",

      "wellspring, in a certain way merge into a unity and tend toward the same end. \n",
      "For Sacred Scripture is the word of God inasmuch as it is consigned to writing \n",

      "and hands it on to their successors in its full purity, so that led by the light \n",
      "of the Spirit of truth, they may in proclaiming it preserve this word of God \n",
      "faithfully, explain it, and make it more widely known. Consequently it is not \n",
      "from Sacred Scripture alone that the Church draws her certainty about everything \n",
      "which has been revealed. Therefore both sacred tradition and Sacred Scripture \n",
      "are to be accepted and venerated with the same sense of loyalty and \n",

      "the Apostles, in the common life, in the breaking of the bread and in prayers \n",

      "foretold by the sacred authors, recounted and explained by them, is found as the \n",
      "true word of God in the books of the Old Testament: these books, therefore, \n",
      "written under divine inspiration, remain permanently valuable. \"For all that was \n",
      "written for our instruction, so that by steadfastness and the encouragement of \n",

      "was to prepare for the coming of Christ, the redeemer of all and of the \n",
      "messianic kingdom, to announce this coming by prophecy (see Luke 24:44; John \n",
      "5:39; 1 Peter 1:10), and to indicate its meaning through various types (see 1 \n",
      "Cor. 10:12). Now the books of the Old Testament, in accordance with the state of \n",
      "mankind before the time of salvation established by Christ, reveal to all men \n",
      "the knowledge of God and of man and the ways in which God, just and merciful, \n",
      "deals with men. These books, though they also contain some things which are \n",
      "incomplete and temporary, nevertheless show us true divine pedagogy. (1) These \n",
      "same books, then, give expression to a lively sense of God, contain a store of \n",
      "sublime teachings about God, sound wisdom about human life, and a wonderful \n",
      "treasury of prayers, and in them the mystery of our salvation is present in a \n",
      "hidden way. Christians should receive them with reverence.</p>\n",
      "<p>16. God, the inspirer and author of both Testaments, wisely arranged that the \n",
      "New Testament be hidden in the Old and the Old be made manifest in the New. (2) \n",
      "For, though Christ established the new covenant in His blood (see Luke 22:20; 1 \n",

      "up into the proclamation of the Gospel, (3) acquire and show forth their full \n",

      "believe (see Rom. 1:16), is set forth and shows its power in a most excellent \n",
      "way in the writings of the New Testament. For when the fullness of time arrived \n",
      "(see Gal. 4:4), the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us in His fullness of \n",
      "graces and truth (see John 1:14). Christ established the kingdom of God on \n",
      "earth, manifested His Father and Himself by deeds and words, and completed His \n",

      "Holy Spirit. Having been lifted up from the earth, He draws all men to Himself \n",
      "(see John 12:32, Greek text), He who alone has the words of eternal life (see \n",
      "John 6:68). This mystery had not been manifested to other generations as it was \n",

      "3:4-6, Greek text), so that they might preach the Gospel, stir up faith in \n",
      "Jesus, Christ and Lord, and gather together the Church. Now the writings of the \n",
      "New Testament stand as a perpetual and divine witness to these realities.</p>\n",
      "<p>18. It is common knowledge that among all the Scriptures, even those of the \n",
      "New Testament, the Gospels have a special preeminence, and rightly so, for they \n",

      "<p>The Church has always and everywhere held and continues to hold that the four \n",

      "living among men, really did and taught for their eternal salvation until the \n",
      "day He was taken up into heaven (see Acts 1:1). Indeed, after the Ascension of \n",

      "been instructed by the glorious events of Christ's life and taught by the light \n",

      "venerates the body of the Lord, since, especially in the sacred liturgy, she \n",
      "unceasingly receives and offers to the faithful the bread of life from the table \n",
      "both of God's word and of Christ's body. She has always maintained them, and \n",
      "continues to do so, together with sacred tradition, as the supreme rule of \n",
      "faith, since, as inspired by God and committed once and for all to writing, they \n",
      "impart the word of God Himself without change, and make the voice of the Holy \n",
      "Spirit resound in the words of the prophets and Apostles. Therefore, like the \n",
      "Christian religion itself, all the preaching of the Church must be nourished and \n",
      "regulated by Sacred Scripture. For in the sacred books, the Father who is in \n",
      "heaven meets His children with great love and speaks with them; and the force \n",
      "and power in the word of God is so great that it stands as the support and \n",
      "energy of the Church, the strength of faith for her sons, the food of the soul, \n",
      "the pure and everlasting source of spiritual life. Consequently these words are \n",
      "perfectly applicable to Sacred Scripture: \"For the word of God is living and \n",
      "active\" (Heb. 4:12) and \"it has power to build you up and give you your heritage \n",
      "among all those who are sanctified\" (Acts 20:32; see 1 Thess. 2:13).</p>\n",
      "<p>22. Easy access to Sacred Scripture should be provided for all the Christian \n",
      "faithful. That is why the Church from the very beginning accepted as her own \n",
      "that very ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament which is called the septuagint; and she has always given a place of honor to other Eastern \n",
      "translations and Latin ones especially the Latin translation known as the \n",
      "vulgate. But since the word of God should be accessible at all times, the Church \n",
      "by her authority and with maternal concern sees to it that suitable and correct \n",
      "translations are made into different languages, especially from the original \n",
      "texts of the sacred books. And should the opportunity arise and the Church \n",
      "authorities approve, if these translations are produced in cooperation with the \n",
      "separated brethren as well, all Christians will be able to use them.</p>\n",
      "<p>23. The bride of the incarnate Word, the Church taught by the Holy Spirit, is \n",
      "concerned to move ahead toward a deeper understanding of the Sacred Scriptures \n",
      "so that she may increasingly feed her sons with the divine words. Therefore, she \n",
      "also encourages the study of the holy Fathers of both East and West and of \n",
      "sacred liturgies. Catholic exegetes then and other students of sacred theology, \n",
      "working diligently together and using appropriate means, should devote their \n",
      "energies, under the watchful care of the sacred teaching office of the Church, \n",
      "to an exploration and exposition of the divine writings. This should be so done \n",
      "that as many ministers of the divine word as possible will be able effectively \n",
      "to provide the nourishment of the Scriptures for the people of God, to enlighten \n",
      "their minds, strengthen their wills, and set men's hearts on fire with the love \n",
      "of God. (1) The sacred synod encourages the sons of the Church and Biblical \n",
      "scholars to continue energetically, following the mind of the Church, with the \n",
      "work they have so well begun, with a constant renewal of vigor. (2)</p>\n",
      "<p>24. Sacred theology rests on the written word of God, together with sacred \n",
      "tradition, as its primary and perpetual foundation. By scrutinizing in the light \n",
      "of faith all truth stored up in the mystery of Christ, theology is most \n",
      "powerfully strengthened and constantly rejuvenated by that word. For the Sacred \n",
      "Scriptures contain the word of God and since they are inspired, really are the \n",
      "word of God; and so the study of the sacred page is, as it were, the soul of \n",
      "sacred theology. (3) By the same word of Scripture the ministry of the word \n",
      "also, that is, pastoral preaching, catechetics and all Christian instruction, in \n",
      "which the liturgical homily must hold the foremost place, is nourished in a \n",
      "healthy way and flourishes in a holy way.  </p>\n",
      "<p>25. Therefore, all the clergy must hold fast to the Sacred Scriptures through \n",
      "diligent sacred reading and careful study, especially the priests of Christ and \n",
      "others, such as deacons and catechists who are legitimately active in the \n",
      "ministry of the word. This is to be done so that none of them will become \"an \n",
      "empty preacher of the word of God outwardly, who is not a listener to it \n",
      "inwardly\" (4) since they must share the abundant wealth of the divine word with \n",
      "the faithful committed to them, especially in the sacred liturgy. The sacred \n",
      "synod also earnestly and especially urges all the Christian faithful, especially \n",
      "Religious, to learn by frequent reading of the divine Scriptures the \"excellent \n",
      "knowledge of Jesus Christ\" (Phil. 3:8). \"For ignorance of the Scriptures is \n",
      "ignorance of Christ.\"(5) Therefore, they should gladly put themselves in touch \n",
      "with the sacred text itself, whether it be through the liturgy, rich in the \n",
      "divine word, or through devotional reading, or through instructions suitable for \n",
      "the purpose and other aids which, in our time, with approval and active support \n",
      "of the shepherds of the Church, are commendably spread everywhere. And let them \n",
      "remember that prayer should accompany the reading of Sacred Scripture, so that \n",
      "God and man may talk together; for \"we speak to Him when we pray; we hear Him \n",
      "when we read the divine saying.\" (6)</p>\n",
      "<p>It devolves on sacred bishops \"who have the apostolic teaching\"(7) to give \n",
      "the faithful entrusted to them suitable instruction in the right use of the \n",
      "divine books, especially the New Testament and above all the Gospels. This can \n",
      "be done through translations of the sacred texts, which are to be provided with \n",
      "the necessary and really adequate explanations so that the children of the \n",
      "Church may safely and profitably become conversant with the Sacred Scriptures \n",
      "and be penetrated with their spirit.</p>\n",
      "<p>Furthermore, editions of the Sacred Scriptures, provided with suitable \n",
      "footnotes, should be prepared also for the use of non-Christians and adapted to \n",
      "their situation. Both pastors of souls and Christians generally should see to \n",
      "the wise distribution of these in one way or another.</p>\n",
      "<p>26. In this way, therefore, through the reading and study of the sacred books \n",
      "\"the word of God may spread rapidly and be glorified\" (2 Thess. 3:1) and the \n",

      "frequent celebration of the Eucharistic mystery, similar we may hope for a new \n",

      "Word made flesh, man might in the Holy Spirit have access to the Father and come \n",

      "abundance of His love speaks to men as friends (see Ex. 33:11; John 15:14-15) \n",
      "and lives among them (see Bar. 3:38), so that He may invite and take them into \n",
      "fellowship with Himself. This plan of revelation is realized by deeds and words \n",
      "having an inner unity: the deeds wrought by God in the history of salvation \n",
      "manifest and confirm the teaching and realities signified by the words, while \n",
      "the words proclaim the deeds and clarify the mystery contained in them. By this \n",
      "revelation then, the deepest truth about God and the salvation of man shines out \n",
      "for our sake in Christ, who is both the mediator and the fullness of all \n",
      "revelation. (2)</p>\n",
      "<p>3. God, who through the Word creates all things (see John 1:3) and keeps them \n",
      "in existence, gives men an enduring witness to Himself in created realities (see \n",
      "Rom. 1:19-20). Planning to make known the way of heavenly salvation, He went \n",
      "further and from the start manifested Himself to our first parents. Then after \n",
      "their fall His promise of redemption aroused in them the hope of being saved \n",
      "(see Gen. 3:15) and from that time on He ceaselessly kept the human race in His \n",

      "salvation (see Rom. 2:6-7). Then, at the time He had appointed He called Abraham \n",
      "in order to make of him a great nation (see Gen. 12:2). Through the patriarchs, \n",
      "and after them through Moses and the prophets, He taught this people to \n",
      "acknowledge Himself the one living and true God, provident father and just \n",
      "judge, and to wait for the Savior promised by Him, and in this manner prepared \n",

      "<p>4. Then, after speaking in many and varied ways through the prophets, \"now at \n",
      "last in these days God has spoken to us in His Son\" (Heb. 1:1-2). For He sent \n",
      "His Son, the eternal Word, who enlightens all men, so that He might dwell among \n",
      "men and tell them of the innermost being of God (see John 1:1-18). Jesus Christ, \n",

      "gave Him to do (see John 5:36; John 17:4). To see Jesus is to see His Father \n",

      "words and deeds, His signs and wonders, but especially through His death and \n",
      "glorious resurrection from the dead and final sending of the Spirit of truth. \n",
      "Moreover He confirmed with divine testimony what revelation proclaimed, that God \n",

      "revelation of the supreme God is brought to completion (see 2 Cor. 1:20; 3:13; \n",
      "4:6), commissioned the Apostles to preach to all men that Gospel which is the \n",
      "source of all saving truth and moral teaching, (1) and to impart to them \n",
      "heavenly gifts. This Gospel had been promised in former times through the \n",

      "too, by those Apostles and apostolic men who under the inspiration of the same \n",
      "Holy Spirit committed the message of salvation to writing. (2)</p>\n",
      "<p>But in order to keep the Gospel forever whole and alive within the Church, \n",
      "the Apostles left bishops as their successors, \"handing over\" to them \"the \n",
      "authority to teach in their own place.\"(3) This sacred tradition, therefore, and \n",
      "Sacred Scripture of both the Old and New Testaments are like a mirror in which \n",
      "the pilgrim Church on earth looks at God, from whom she has received everything, \n",
      "until she is brought finally to see Him as He is, face to face (see 1 John 3:2).</p>\n",
      "<p>8. And so the apostolic preaching, which is expressed in a special way in the \n",
      "inspired books, was to be preserved by an unending succession of preachers until \n",
      "the end of time. Therefore the Apostles, handing on what they themselves had \n",
      "received, warn the faithful to hold fast to the traditions which they have \n",
      "learned either by word of mouth or by letter (see 2 Thess. 2:15), and to fight \n",
      "in defense of the faith handed on once and for all (see Jude 1:3) (4) Now what \n",
      "was handed on by the Apostles includes everything which contributes toward the \n",

      "unceasingly receives and offers to the faithful the bread of life from the table \n",

      "impart the word of God Himself without change, and make the voice of the Holy \n",
      "Spirit resound in the words of the prophets and Apostles. Therefore, like the \n",
      "Christian religion itself, all the preaching of the Church must be nourished and \n",
      "regulated by Sacred Scripture. For in the sacred books, the Father who is in \n",
      "heaven meets His children with great love and speaks with them; and the force \n",
      "and power in the word of God is so great that it stands as the support and \n",
      "energy of the Church, the strength of faith for her sons, the food of the soul, \n",
      "the pure and everlasting source of spiritual life. Consequently these words are \n",
      "perfectly applicable to Sacred Scripture: \"For the word of God is living and \n",
      "active\" (Heb. 4:12) and \"it has power to build you up and give you your heritage \n",
      "among all those who are sanctified\" (Acts 20:32; see 1 Thess. 2:13).</p>\n",
      "<p>22. Easy access to Sacred Scripture should be provided for all the Christian \n",
      "faithful. That is why the Church from the very beginning accepted as her own \n",
      "that very ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament which is called the septuagint; and she has always given a place of honor to other Eastern \n",
      "translations and Latin ones especially the Latin translation known as the \n",
      "vulgate. But since the word of God should be accessible at all times, the Church \n",

      "translations are made into different languages, especially from the original \n",
      "texts of the sacred books. And should the opportunity arise and the Church \n",
      "authorities approve, if these translations are produced in cooperation with the \n",

      "concerned to move ahead toward a deeper understanding of the Sacred Scriptures \n",
      "so that she may increasingly feed her sons with the divine words. Therefore, she \n",
      "also encourages the study of the holy Fathers of both East and West and of \n",

      "working diligently together and using appropriate means, should devote their \n",
      "energies, under the watchful care of the sacred teaching office of the Church, \n",
      "to an exploration and exposition of the divine writings. This should be so done \n",
      "that as many ministers of the divine word as possible will be able effectively \n",
      "to provide the nourishment of the Scriptures for the people of God, to enlighten \n",
      "their minds, strengthen their wills, and set men's hearts on fire with the love \n",
      "of God. (1) The sacred synod encourages the sons of the Church and Biblical \n",

      "powerfully strengthened and constantly rejuvenated by that word. For the Sacred \n",
      "Scriptures contain the word of God and since they are inspired, really are the \n",
      "word of God; and so the study of the sacred page is, as it were, the soul of \n",
      "sacred theology. (3) By the same word of Scripture the ministry of the word \n",
      "also, that is, pastoral preaching, catechetics and all Christian instruction, in \n",
      "which the liturgical homily must hold the foremost place, is nourished in a \n",

      "ministry of the word. This is to be done so that none of them will become \"an \n",
      "empty preacher of the word of God outwardly, who is not a listener to it \n",

      "knowledge of Jesus Christ\" (Phil. 3:8). \"For ignorance of the Scriptures is \n",
      "ignorance of Christ.\"(5) Therefore, they should gladly put themselves in touch \n",
      "with the sacred text itself, whether it be through the liturgy, rich in the \n",
      "divine word, or through devotional reading, or through instructions suitable for \n",
      "the purpose and other aids which, in our time, with approval and active support \n",
      "of the shepherds of the Church, are commendably spread everywhere. And let them \n",
      "remember that prayer should accompany the reading of Sacred Scripture, so that \n",
      "God and man may talk together; for \"we speak to Him when we pray; we hear Him \n",
      "when we read the divine saying.\" (6)</p>\n",
      "<p>It devolves on sacred bishops \"who have the apostolic teaching\"(7) to give \n",
      "the faithful entrusted to them suitable instruction in the right use of the \n",
      "divine books, especially the New Testament and above all the Gospels. This can \n",
      "be done through translations of the sacred texts, which are to be provided with \n",
      "the necessary and really adequate explanations so that the children of the \n",
